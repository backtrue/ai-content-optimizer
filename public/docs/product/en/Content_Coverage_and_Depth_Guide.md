## Preface: Why Is "Content Coverage and Depth" So Important?

In the age of AI search, Google no longer just looks at "keyword density"—it evaluates whether your content comprehensively addresses all aspects of a topic.

**Content Coverage and Depth** measures:
- Does your content cover all important aspects of the topic?
- Is your content deep enough, or just surface-level?
- Does your content stay focused on the topic, avoiding tangents?

Low scores mean:
- Content is too shallow, lacking depth
- Content is incomplete, missing important aspects
- Content is scattered, unfocused on the main topic

This guide uses the Golden Circle framework (WHY/HOW/WHAT) to help you diagnose problems, understand root causes, and implement concrete improvement strategies.

## Part One: WHY - Why Is Your Content Coverage and Depth Low?

### 1.1 Root Cause Diagnosis

#### **Problem 1: Your Content Is Too Shallow, Lacking Depth**

Many content creators write "surface-level" content instead of "in-depth analysis."

**Typical Example:**
- Searcher wants to understand "complete SEO strategy"
- Your content: "SEO includes technical SEO, content SEO, and link SEO"
- Problem: Just listing, no deep explanation of each aspect

#### **Problem 2: Your Content Is Incomplete, Missing Important Aspects**

Even if your content has depth, missing important aspects makes it feel incomplete.

**Common Gaps:**
- Missing the "why" (principles)
- Missing the "how" (steps)
- Missing "common questions" (Q&A)
- Missing "advanced techniques" (extended content)

#### **Problem 3: Your Content Is Scattered, Unfocused on the Main Topic**

Content jumps around too much, making it hard for readers to follow the logic.

**Common Problems:**
- No logical connection between paragraphs
- Suddenly introducing unrelated topics
- Repeating the same point
- No clear paragraph transitions

#### **Problem 4: Your Content Is Too Short, Lacking Substance**

While word count isn't the only factor, short content usually indicates insufficient depth.

**Common Situations:**
- Content under 500 words
- Only 1-2 paragraphs per main topic
- Lack of examples and case studies

### 1.2 Impact of Low Coverage and Depth

**Short-term Impact:**
- Ranking decline
- AI search won't fully cite your content
- Users will seek more comprehensive resources

**Long-term Impact:**
- Brand perceived as "unprofessional"
- Difficult to establish thought leadership
- Traffic and conversion rates drop

## Part Two: HOW - How to Diagnose and Improve Coverage and Depth

### 2.1 Diagnostic Method: Five-Step Checklist

#### **Step 1: Check If Your Content Covers All Important Aspects**

**Method:**
1. Search your target keyword
2. Review the top 3 competitor articles
3. Note all major aspects they cover
4. Check if your content covers them too

**Improvement Plan:**
If you're missing aspects, add new sections.

#### **Step 2: Check the Depth of Each Aspect**

Use the "Depth Test":
- For each major aspect, ask: "Did I explain the 'why,' 'how,' and 'common questions'?"
- If you only covered one, you need to add more

#### **Step 3: Check Your Content's Logical Flow**

Use the "Outline Test":
- Can you understand the article's logic by reading only headings?
- Are there clear transitions between paragraphs?
- Are there any abrupt topic jumps?

#### **Step 4: Check Your Content's Word Count and Paragraph Density**

Calculate:
- Is your total word count over 1500 words?
- Does each major aspect have at least 200-300 words?
- Do you have enough examples and case studies?

#### **Step 5: Check Topic Focus**

Scan your content for:
- How many paragraphs "go off-topic"?
- How many repeated points?
- Is there a clear "core topic"?

### 2.2 Improvement Strategy: Three-Layer Optimization

#### **Layer One: Expand Content Structure (Quick Win)**

**Improvement Formula:**

Each major aspect = Definition + Principles + Steps + Examples + FAQ

- Steps: How to implement technical SEO?
- Examples: Real-world technical SEO case studies
- FAQ: Common technical SEO misconceptions
```

#### **Layer Two: Fill Missing Aspects (Medium-term)**

**Improvement Steps:**
1. List aspects competitors cover that you don't
2. Add 200-300 words for each missing aspect
3. Ensure relevance to your main topic

#### **Layer Three: Optimize Logical Flow (Long-term)**

**Improvement Plan:**
1. Check transitions between paragraphs
2. Add "transition sentences" to guide readers

## Frequently Asked Questions

- Educational: 2000-3000 words
