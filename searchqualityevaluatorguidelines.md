## General Guidelines Overview

## **Welcome to the Search Quality Rating Program\!** As a Search Quality Rater, you will work on many different types of rating projects. The General Guidelines primarily cover Page Quality (PQ) rating and Needs Met (NM) rating; however, the concepts are also important for many other types of rating tasks. For brevity, we refer to “Search Quality Raters” as “raters” in these guidelines.

## Introduction to Search Quality Rating

### 0.0 The Search Experience

## The World Wide Web is a vast collection of online information and content. Internet search engines provide a powerful way to explore this online universe. There are many ways people search: people may type words into a search box in a browser, speak to a mobile phone or assistant device, use search engine autocomplete features, etc. People search the Internet for a variety of purposes, ranging from accomplishing a quick task to researching a topic in depth. A search may be part of a long-term project, such as a home remodel or vacation planning. A search may be done when someone is bored and looking for entertainment, such as a search for \[funny videos\]. A search may be a single question asked during a critical moment of a person's life, such as \[what are the symptoms of a heart attack?\]. Search engines exist to help people find what they are looking for. To do that, search engines must provide a diverse set of helpful, high quality search results, presented in the most helpful order. Different types of searches need very different types of search results. Medical search results should be high quality, authoritative, and trustworthy. Search results for \[cute baby animal pictures\] should be adorable. Search results for a specific website or webpage should have that desired result at the top. Searches that have many possible meanings or involve many perspectives need a diverse set of results that reflect the natural diversity of meanings and points of view. People all over the world use search engines; therefore, diversity in search results is essential to satisfy the diversity of people who use search. Finally, search results should help people. Search results should provide authoritative and trustworthy information, not lead people astray with misleading content. Search results should allow people to find what they're looking for, not surprise people with unpleasant, upsetting, offensive, or disturbing content. Harmful, hateful, violent, or sexually explicit search results are only appropriate if the person phrased their search in a way that makes it clear that they are looking for this type of content, ***and*** there is no other reasonable interpretation of the words used in their search.

### 0.1 The Purpose of Search Quality Rating

## As a Search Quality Rater, you will help evaluate search engine quality around the world. Good search engines give results that are helpful for people in their own specific language and locale. No single rating can directly impact how a particular webpage, website, or result appears in Google Search, nor can it cause specific webpages, websites, or results to move up or down on the search results page. Using ratings to position results on the search results page would not be feasible, as humans could never individually rate each page on the open web. Instead, ratings are used to measure how effectively search engines are working to deliver helpful content to people around the world. Ratings are also used to improve search engines by providing examples of helpful and unhelpful results for different searches. As part of your role in the search quality rating program, it is important that you are familiar with and comfortable using a search engine. We encourage you to be an expert in search\! For example, experiment with using operators (e.g., quotes or a hyphen) in your searches or try using advanced search options.

### 0.2 Raters Must Represent People in their Rating Locale

## It is very important for you to represent people in the locale you evaluate. You must be very familiar with the task language and location in order to represent the experience of people in your locale. If you do not have the knowledge to do this, please inform your employer/company. Unless your rating task indicates otherwise, your ratings should be based on the instructions and examples given in these guidelines. Ratings should not be based on your personal opinions, preferences, religious beliefs, or political views. Always use your best judgment and represent the cultural standards of your rating locale.

### 0.3 Browser Requirements

## Check with your employer/company for browser requirements. You may use helpful browser add-ons or extensions, but please do not use add-ons or extensions that interfere with or alter the user experience of the page.

### 0.4 Ad Blocking Extensions

## Do not use add-ons or extensions that block ads for Needs Met rating or Page Quality rating. These add-ons or extensions may cause you to give incorrect ratings. As a rater, only use an ad blocking extension or add-on if specifically instructed to do so in the project-specific instructions. **Important** : Some browsers such as Chrome automatically block some ads. As a rater, you are required to turn off any ad blocker capabilities of the browser you use to view webpages for rating tasks. Check your browser settings before rating tasks to ensure your ratings accurately reflect how people experience the page without ad blocking settings and extensions. For more information about Chrome Ad Blocking, see Chrome Support Page for Ad Blocking Settings.

### 0.5 Internet Safety Information

## In the course of your work, you will visit many different webpages. Some of them may harm your computer unless you are careful. Please do not download any executables, applications, or other potentially dangerous files, or click on any links that you are uncomfortable with. **It is strongly recommended that you have antivirus and antispyware protection on your computer. This software** **must be updated frequently or your computer will not be protected. There are many free and for-purchase** **antivirus and antispyware products available on the web**. See here for a Wikipedia page on antivirus software and here for a Wikipedia page on spyware. We suggest that you only open files with which you are comfortable. The file formats listed below are generally considered safe if antivirus software is in place. ● .txt (text files) ● .ppt or .pptx (Microsoft PowerPoint) ● .doc or .docx (Microsoft Word) ● .xls or .xlsx (Microsoft Excel) ● .pdf (PDF files) (Adobe Acrobat) If you encounter a page with a warning message, such as “Warning-visiting this web site may harm your computer,” or if your antivirus software warns you about a page, you should not try to visit the page to assign a rating.

### 0.6 The Role of Examples in these Guidelines

## The rating concepts in these guidelines apply to all types of content. The examples throughout these guidelines are very important to illustrate how the concepts defined in each section should be applied in rating tasks for different types of webpages and different types of content. Please view each example and keep the following in mind: ● Webpages and websites change rapidly, so we use images or "snapshots" of webpages in most of our examples. ● Because some types of content are difficult to view in "snapshot" form, a description of the webpage is provided for each example. ● The information in the examples was accurate at the time it was added, but content and websites may change over time. ● Some examples show pages on desktop and some show pages on mobile devices.

## Part 1: Page Quality Rating Guideline

### 1.0 Introduction to Page Quality Rating

## A Page Quality (PQ) rating task consists of a URL and a grid to record your observations as you explore the landing page and the website associated with the URL. The goal of PQ rating is to evaluate how well the page achieves its purpose. Here's what you'll need to be a successful Page Quality rater: ● Your experience using the web as an ordinary user in your rating locale. ● In-depth knowledge of these guidelines. ● And most importantly—practice doing PQ rating tasks\!

### 2.0 Understanding Webpages and Websites

## Page Quality rating requires an in-depth understanding of websites. We'll start with the basics. Along the way, we'll share important information about Page Quality rating, so please read through this section even if you are a website expert\!

#### 2.1 Important Definitions

## Here are some important definitions: A **search engine** is a tool to help people find or interact with content available on the Internet. In these guidelines, the word " **user** " refers to a person trying to find information or accomplish a task on the Internet. Users are people from many different backgrounds, whose experiences and needs may differ from your own: people of all ages, genders, races, religions, political affiliations, etc. A **webpage** is connected to the World Wide Web and can be viewed or "visited" using a web browser (e.g., Chrome), a browser on your phone, or a search app. In the 1990s, webpage content was mostly text and links. Today, webpage content includes many forms of media (such as images, videos, etc.) and functionality (such as online shopping features, email, calculator functionality, online games, etc.). A **URL** is a string of letters, numbers, and punctuation that your web browser uses to “find” and display a webpage. Page Quality rating doesn't require you to have in-depth understanding of the structure of URLs, i.e., you don’t need to know the difference between host, domain, etc. But if you are interested, see here to read more. A **website** or **site** is a group of World Wide Web pages usually containing hyperlinks to each other and made available online by an individual, company, educational institution, government, or organization. Popular websites include Facebook, Wikipedia, Yahoo, YouTube, etc. **Note** : In these guidelines, we will use the word “website” to refer to a collection of pages owned and controlled by a single entity (individual, business, etc.). But we will also use “website” to refer to major “independent” sections (or hosts) of some websites that were created to achieve separate purposes. For example, the Yahoo website is organized into different sections (or hosts), such as Yahoo Finance ( finance.yahoo.com ), Yahoo Mail ( mail.yahoo.com ), Yahoo Sports ( sports.yahoo.com ), etc. Each of these has its own purpose. It’s OK to refer to each of these sections as a website; for example, the Yahoo Finance website and the Yahoo Sports website. You may also refer to pages on Yahoo Finance or Yahoo Sports as belonging to the Yahoo website. A **homepage** of a website is the main page of the site. It is usually the first page that users see when the site loads. For example, [http://www.apple.com](http://www.apple.com/) is the homepage of the Apple site, [http://www.yahoo.com](http://www.yahoo.com/) is the homepage of the Yahoo company site, and [http://finance.yahoo.com](http://finance.yahoo.com/) is the homepage of Yahoo Finance. You can usually find the homepage of a website by clicking on a “home” link or logo link on subpages of a website. A **website owner** is the person, company, or organization who is responsible for a website.

## A **content creator** is the individual(s) or entity (business, organization, etc.) who created the content on a webpage. **Generative AI** is a type of machine learning (ML) model that can take what it has learned from the examples it has been provided to create new content, such as text, images, music, and code. Learn more here. Different tools leverage these models to create generative AI content. Generative AI can be a helpful tool for content creation, but like any tool, it can also be misused. **Important** *:* You must be very comfortable exploring websites, both by clicking links and modifying URLs in the address bar of your web browser. Become a website detective and explorer\!

#### 2.2 Understanding the Purpose of a Webpage

## The purpose of a page is the reason or reasons why the page was created. Every page on the Internet is created for a purpose, or for multiple purposes. Most pages are created to be helpful for people, thus having a beneficial purpose. Some pages are created merely to make money, with little or no effort to help people. Some pages are even created to harm users. The first step in understanding a page is figuring out its purpose. Why is it important to determine the purpose of the page for PQ rating? ● The goal of PQ rating is to determine how well a page achieves its purpose. In order to assign a rating, you must understand the purpose of the page and sometimes the website. ● By understanding the purpose of the page, you'll better understand what criteria are important to consider when evaluating that particular page. ● Websites and pages should be created to help people. If that is not the case, a rating of **Lowest** may be warranted. More on this later. As long as the page is created to help people, we will not consider any particular page purpose or type to be higher quality than another. For example, encyclopedia pages are not necessarily higher quality than humor pages. **Important** : There are highest quality and lowest quality webpages of all different types and purposes: shopping pages, news pages, forum pages, video pages, pages with error messages, PDFs, images, gossip pages, humor pages, homepages, and all other types of pages. The type of page does not determine the PQ rating—you have to understand the purpose of the page to determine the rating. Common helpful or beneficial page purposes include (but are not limited to): ● To share information about a topic. ● To share a personal experience, perspective, or feelings on a topic. ● To share pictures, videos, or other forms of media. ● To demonstrate a personal talent or skill. ● To express an opinion or point of view. ● To entertain. ● To offer products or services. ● To allow people to post questions for other users to answer. ● To allow people to share files or to download software. ● To allow people to support a charity or other cause they care about. Here are a few examples where it is easy to understand the purpose of the page: **Type of Page Purpose of the Page** News website homepage To inform users about recent or important events. Shopping page To sell or give information about the product. Video page To share a cute video of a cat. Currency converter page To calculate equivalent amounts in different currencies.

## Here is an example (OmNomNomNom Page) of a helpful page where the purpose of the page is not as obvious. At first glance, this page may seem pointless or strange. However, it is a page from a humorous site that encourages users to post photos with mouths drawn on them. The purpose of the page is humor or artistic expression. This page has a helpful or beneficial purpose. Even though the About page on this website is not very helpful, the website explains itself on its FAQ page.

#### 2.3 Your Money or Your Life (YMYL) Topics

## Pages on the World Wide Web are about a vast variety of topics. Some topics have a high risk of harm because content about these topics could significantly impact the health, financial stability, or safety of people, or the welfare or well-being of society. We call these topics “Your Money or Your Life” or YMYL. YMYL topics may significantly impact or harm one or more of the following: ● the person who is directly viewing or using the content ● other people who are affected by the person who viewed the content ● groups of people or society affected by the actions of people who viewed the content YMYL topics can directly and significantly impact people’s health, financial stability or safety, or the welfare or well-being of society, because of the following reasons: ● **The topic itself is harmful or dangerous**. For example, there is clear and present harm directly associated with topics related to self-harm, criminal acts, or violent extremism. ● **The topic could cause harm if the content is not accurate and trustworthy**. For example, mild inaccuracies or content from less reliable sources could significantly impact someone's health, financial stability, or safety, or impact society, for topics like: symptoms of a heart attack, how to invest money, what to do if there is an earthquake, who can vote, or needed qualifications for obtaining a driver’s license. To determine whether a topic is YMYL, assess the following types of harm that might occur: ● **YMYL Health or Safety** : Topics that could harm mental, physical, and emotional health, or any form of safety such as physical safety or safety online. ● **YMYL Financial Security** : Topics that could damage a person's ability to support themselves and their families. ● **YMYL Government, Civics & Society** : Topics that could negatively impact groups of people, issues of public interest, trust in public institutions, election and voting information, and any other informational topics about government, civics or society that impacts people's lives. ● **YMYL Othe** r: Topics that could hurt people or negatively impact welfare or well-being of society. It's possible to imagine a hypothetical harmful page for any non-harmful topic, such as the science behind rainbows or shopping for pencils: for either of these topics, someone could build a page that has a malicious computer virus download. However, for a specific topic to be YMYL, the topic itself must potentially impact people’s health, financial stability, or safety, or the welfare or well-being of society. Many or most topics are not YMYL and do not require a high level of accuracy or trust *to prevent harm*. Because YMYL assessment is a spectrum, it may be helpful to think of topics as clear YMYL **,** definitely not YMYL or something in between. Pages on clear YMYL topics require the most scrutiny for Page Quality rating.

## **Type of Topic Clear YMYL Topic May be YMYL Topic** **Not or Unlikely YMYL** **Topic** **Information** Could significant harm result from inaccurate information? **Evacuation routes for a** **tsunami** **Explanation** : Inaccurate information on evacuation routes could cause significant harm to people. **Weather forecast** **Explanation** : In most situations, slightly inaccurate information about the weather forecast will not cause harm. People often ask family members "what's the weather today". **Music award winners** **Explanation** : This topic is unlikely to cause harm. **Advice about an activity** Could significant harm result from poor advice? **When to go to the** **emergency room** **Explanation** : Bad advice on when to go to the emergency room could cause significant harm. **How often to replace a** **toothbrush** **Explanation** : This is a casual health topic people commonly discuss with friends. A slightly imperfect suggestion is unlikely to significantly impact health or safety. **How frequently to wash** **jeans** **Explanation** : This topic is unlikely to cause harm. **A personal opinion** What impact could this opinion have on other people and society? **Personal opinion about why** **a racial group is inferior** **Explanation** : Pages on this topic have been used to justify or incite violence against groups of people. **Personal opinion about why** **an exercise is inferior** **Explanation** : While there may be a health concern if the exercise is extreme or risky, most discussions of jogging vs swimming, etc. involve personal preference. **Personal opinion about why** **a rock band is inferior** **Explanation** : This topic is unlikely to cause harm, although there may be strong opinions involved\! **News about current events** Could this topic significantly impact people and society? For societal impact, consider issues such as elections and trust in public institutions that benefit society. **News about ongoing** **violence** **Explanation** : People need accurate information to stay safe. Society may also be impacted by information about ongoing violence, as citizens and governments make civic decisions accordingly. **News about a car accident** **Explanation** : The accident itself may have been harmful, but there is likely little risk of future harm from small inaccuracies in reporting about an incident. **News about a local high** **school basketball game** **Explanation** : This topic is unlikely to cause harm. **Sharing on social media** Could the social media post cause significant harm? Could it hurt individuals? Could it damage society if widely shared? **A tide pod challenge post** **Explanation** : This harmful social media challenge was responsible for deaths. **A hot sauce challenge** **Explanation** : While some people may experience some discomfort by tasting various hot sauces, it is unlikely that sharing about such challenges would cause significant harm. **A music video** **Explanation** : This type of content generally has little risk of harm. **Online commerce and** **product reviews** Consider the product. Could the product cause significant harm? **Purchasing prescription** **drugs** **Explanation** : Prescription drugs have the potential to cause harm and require purchase from licensed pharmacies. **Review of a type of car** **Explanation** : While cars are big purchases, many people ask friends and family about cars. **Purchasing pencils** **Explanation** : Pencils and other everyday items are unlikely to cause harm.

## If you are having trouble deciding whether a topic is YMYL, consider the following questions:

1. ## Would a careful person seek out experts or highly trusted sources *to prevent harm*? Could even minor    inaccuracies cause harm? If yes, then the topic is likely YMYL.

2. ## Is the specific topic one that most people would be content with only casually consulting their friends about? If    yes, the topic is likely not YMYL.    **Important** : For pages about clear YMYL topics, we have very high Page Quality rating standards because low quality    pages on such topics could potentially negatively impact a person’s health, financial stability, or safety, or the welfare or    well-being of society.

#### 2.4 Understanding Webpage Content

## All of the content on a webpage can be classified as one of the following: Main Content (MC), Supplementary Content (SC), or Advertisements/Monetization (Ads). In order to understand the purpose of a webpage and do PQ rating, you will need to be able to distinguish among these different parts of the page. Webpage design can be complicated, so make sure to click around and explore the page. See what kind of content is behind the tabs and test out the interactive page features. Content behind the tabs may be considered part of the MC, SC, or Ads, depending on what the content is.

##### 2.4.1 Identifying the Main Content (MC)

## Main Content is any part of the page that directly helps the page achieve its purpose. MC can be text, images, videos, page features (e.g., calculators, games), and it can be content created by website users, such as videos, reviews, articles, comments posted by users, etc. Tabs on some pages lead to even more information (e.g., customer reviews) and can sometimes be considered part of the MC. The MC also includes the title at the top of the page ( example ). Descriptive MC titles allow users to make informed decisions about what pages to visit. Helpful titles summarize the MC on the page. **Type of Page and Purpose MC Highlighted in Yellow** News website homepage: the purpose is to inform users about recent or important events. MC \- News Homepage News article page: the purpose is to communicate information about an event or news topic. MC \- News Article Store product page: the purpose is to sell or give information about the product. ● Content behind the Reviews, Shipping, and Safety Information tabs are considered to be part of the MC. MC \- Shopping Page Currency converter page: the purpose is to calculate equivalent amounts in different currencies.

MC \- Blog Post Page Search engine homepage: the purpose is to allow users to enter a query and search the Internet. MC \- Search Engine Homepage Bank login page: the purpose is to allow users to log in to bank online. MC \- Bank Login Page

##### 2.4.2 Identifying the Supplementary Content (SC)

## Supplementary Content contributes to a good user experience on the page, but does not directly help the page achieve its purpose. SC is an important part of the user experience. One common type of SC is navigation links that allow users to visit other parts of the website. In some cases, content behind tabs may be considered part of the SC. Sometimes the easiest way to identify SC is to look for the parts of the page that *are not* MC or Ads. **Type of Page and Purpose SC Highlighted in Blue** News article page: the purpose is to communicate information about an event or news topic. SC \- News Article Store product page: the purpose is to sell or give information about the product. SC \- Shopping Page Blog post page: the purpose is to share music used on a TV show. SC \- Blog Post Page

##### 2.4.3 Identifying Advertisements/Monetization (Ads)

## Ads may contribute to a good user experience. Advertisements/Monetization (Ads) is content and/or links that are displayed for the purpose of monetizing (making money from) the page. The presence or absence of Ads is not by itself a reason for a **High** or **Low** quality rating. Without advertising and monetization, some webpages could not exist because it costs money to maintain a website and create high quality content. There are many different ways to monetize a webpage, including advertisements and affiliate programs. See here for more information on website monetization. Note that monetization on mobile pages may be more subtle than monetization on desktop pages. The most common type of monetization is advertisements. Ads may be labeled as "ads," "sponsored links," “sponsored listings,” “sponsored results,” etc. Ads may change when you reload the page, and different users may see different Ads on the same page. Website owners can choose to display Ads on their page (such as by joining an advertising network ), but they may not always directly control the content of the Ads. However, we will consider a website responsible for the overall quality of the Ads displayed. **Important:** For the purpose of these guidelines, we will consider monetized links of any type to be “Ads.” See here for different types of website monetization. **Type of Page and Purpose Ads Highlighted in Red** News article page: the purpose is to communicate information about an event or news topic. Ads \- News Article Blog post page: the purpose is to share music used on a TV show. Ads \- Blog Post Page Store product page: the purpose is to sell or give information about the product. No ads – Shopping Page

##### 2.4.4 Summary of the Parts of the Page

## Let's put it all together. ● **Main Content (MC)** is any part of the page that directly helps the page achieve its purpose. MC is (or should be\!) the reason the page exists. The quality of the MC plays a very large role in the Page Quality rating of a webpage. ● **Supplementary Content (SC)** is also important. SC can help a page better achieve its purpose or it can detract from the overall experience. ● Many pages have **advertisements/monetization (Ads)**. Without advertising and monetization, some webpages could not exist because it costs money to maintain a website and create high quality content. The presence or absence of Ads is not by itself a reason for a **High** or **Low** quality rating. On some pages, user reviews and comments may be considered MC, and on other pages they may be considered SC. Use your best judgment and think about the purpose of the page.

## Do not worry too much about identifying every little part of the page. Think about which parts of the page are the MC. Next, look for the Ads. Anything left over can be considered SC. **Type of Page and Purpose MC, SC, & Ads Highlighted** News article page: the purpose is to communicate information about an event or news topic. Summary \- News Article Store product page: the purpose is to sell or give information about the product.

Summary \- Currency Converter Blog post page: the purpose is to share music used on a TV show. Summary \- Blog Post Page Bank login page: the purpose is to allow users to log in to the bank online. Summary \- Bank Login Page

#### 2.5 Understanding the Website

## Pages often make more sense when viewed as part of a website. Some of the criteria in Page Quality rating are based on understanding the website that the page belongs to. To understand a website, start by finding out who is responsible for the website and who created the content on the page (more information provided in Section 2.5.2 ). Then, look for information about the website and/or content creators on the website itself. Websites and content creators are usually very eager to tell you all about themselves\! You must also look for reputation information about the website and/or content creators. What do outside, independent sources say about them? When there is disagreement between what the website or content creators say about themselves and what reputable independent sources say, trust the independent sources.

##### 2.5.1 Finding the Homepage

## The homepage of a website usually contains or has links to important information about the website. Website owners usually make it easy to get to the homepage from any page on the site. Here's how to find the homepage of a website:

1. ## Examine the landing page of the URL in your PQ rating task.

2. ## Find and click on the link labeled with the name or logo of the website (occasionally labeled as “home” or “main”),    which usually appears at the top of the page.    Sometimes, you may be given a webpage or website that appears to have no navigation links, no homepage link, and no    logo or other means to find the homepage. Even some **High** or **Highest** quality pages lack a way to navigate to the    homepage. If you can't find a link to the homepage, modify the URL by removing everything to the right of “.com,” “.org,”    “.net,” “.fr,” etc. and refresh the page.    Occasionally, your rating task will include a URL for which there are two or more justifiable “homepage” candidates. For    example, you may not be sure whether the homepage of the URL https://finance.yahoo.com/calendar is    [http://finance.yahoo.com](http://finance.yahoo.com/) or [http://www.yahoo.com](http://www.yahoo.com/).    **Important** : When you have more than one homepage “candidate,” please use whichever one offers the most information    about the specific webpage in the rating task. Use your judgment. The goal is to understand the webpage and the    website(s) it is associated with, not find the one unique, correct homepage.

## In the following examples, we have included the URL of the page to be evaluated in the rating task, as well as the URL of its associated homepage. We have also included an image that shows where to click on the landing page to navigate to the homepage. In the image, you will see a red box around the link or logo you would click to navigate to the homepage. **URL of the Task Page Homepage of the Website Where to click to get to the Homepage** [http://www.williams-sonoma.c](http://www.williams-sonoma.c/) om/products/shun-premier-7- piece-knife-block-set [http://www.williams-sonoma.com](http://www.williams-sonoma.com/) Williams-Sonoma Homepage This “WILLIAMS-SONOMA” logo shown in the upper center of the page is clickable and takes users to the homepage of the website. [http://hms.harvard.edu/about-](http://hms.harvard.edu/about-) hms/facts-figures [http://hms.harvard.edu](http://hms.harvard.edu/) In this case, we will consider the Harvard Medical School page at [http://hms.harvard.edu](http://hms.harvard.edu/) to be the homepage, rather than [http://www.harvard.edu](http://www.harvard.edu/) (which is the homepage of Harvard University). Clicking the logo at the top of [http://hms.harvard.edu/about-hms/facts-figures](http://hms.harvard.edu/about-hms/facts-figures) takes users to [http://hms.harvard.edu](http://hms.harvard.edu/) , not to [http://www.harvard.edu](http://www.harvard.edu/). Harvard Medical School Facts and Figures Page This “Harvard Medical School” logo in the upper left part of the page is clickable and takes users to the homepage of the Harvard Medical School website.

##### 2.5.2 Finding Who is Responsible for the Website and Who Created the Content on the Page

## Every page belongs to a website, and it should be clear: ● Who (what individuals, company, business, organization, government agency, etc.) is responsible for the website. ● Who (what individuals, company, business, organization, government agency, etc.) created the content on the page you are evaluating. Note that for pages on websites such as forums and social media platforms, people may post content using an alias or username in order to avoid sharing personally identifiable information online. In these cases, the alias or username is an acceptable way to identify the content creator. Websites are usually very clear about who is responsible for the website and who created the content on the page. There are many reasons for this: ● People may want to showcase their own personal talent, experiences, and perspectives. ● Artists, authors, musicians, and other original content creators may want to be known and appreciated. ● Commercial websites may have copyrighted material they want to protect. ● Businesses and organizations may want people to know who they are and what they do. ● Stores want customers to feel comfortable buying their products online. Most websites have “contact us” or “about us” or “about” pages that provide information about who owns the site. Many companies have an entire website or blog devoted to who they are and what they are doing, what jobs are available, etc. Here are some examples: ● Google Official Blog ● Marriott Blog ● Southwest Airlines Blog ● Netflix Tech Blog

## In PQ rating tasks, you will need to identify who created the MC on the page. To help you do so, the table below describes the primary content creators for common webpage types. These types can overlap (e.g., a page may have multiple articles, some written by individual authors or journalists and others written by the website owner). **Webpage Type Examples Primary Content Creator(s)** **The website owner created the page** **and much of the MC on the page** The page may have comments, reviews, or other content posted by users, but the page itself is the responsibility of the website. ● Homepage of a business website ● Introductory page on a personal website ● Product page on an online merchant website The website itself can be viewed as the primary content creator. Website owners may have content created on their behalf (e.g., a small business may hire a professional web developer to build their website), but they are ultimately responsible for the MC. User comments and reviews may play a significant role on the page. As long as the website creates and actively maintains the page, the website is considered to be the primary content creator. **The website owner created the page,** **and the MC is produced by authors or** **other content creators identified by** **the website** The website decides what to publish and is responsible for the content, but there are distinct authors or content creators who provide the MC on the page. ● Newspaper opinion piece written by the editorial board ● Magazine article written by an individual journalist ● Scientific journal paper written by a team of academic researchers The primary content creators are the journalists, scientists, etc. listed as authors of the content. Often the content creators are individuals, but an organization, company, or institution may also be the content creator. User comments may be present, but they typically are not the focus of the page. **The webpage consists of social media** **post(s) from a single account** **representing an individual content** **creator or organization** The social media website owner enables people and organizations to create accounts to post text, images, videos, and other types of content under their account. ● Social media post ● Local business profile page on a social media website ● Video channel on a video sharing website The primary content creator is the person or organization who created the account and is posting the MC. There may be information about the content creator on a profile page found on the website. Other user comments and reactions such as "likes" may be considered part of the MC. **The webpage is created by multiple** **users engaging in discussion or** **posting on social media** The website owner enables people to post text, images, and videos or have conversations with other users of the website. ● Forum discussion thread ● Q\&A question page ● Search results page on a social media website showing content from many different users The people posting are the content creators. There is no single primary content creator, and people may be identified only by aliases or usernames.

##### 2.5.3 Finding About Us, Contact Information, and Customer Service Information

## Many websites are interested in communicating with their users. There are many reasons that users might have for contacting a website, from reporting problems such as broken pages, to asking for content removal. Many websites offer multiple ways for users to contact the website: email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, web contact forms, etc. Sometimes, this contact information is even organized by department and provides the names of individuals to contact. The types and amount of contact information needed depend on the type of website. Contact information and customer service information are extremely important for websites that handle money, such as stores, banks, credit card companies, etc. Users need a way to ask questions or get help when a problem occurs. For shopping websites, we'll ask you to do some special checks. Look for contact information—including the store’s policies on payment, exchanges, and returns. Sometimes this information is listed under “customer service.” Some kinds of websites need fewer details and a smaller amount of contact information for their purpose. For example, humor websites may not need the level of detailed contact information we would expect from online banking websites. Occasionally, you may encounter a website or content creator with a legitimate reason for anonymity. For example, personal websites may omit personal contact information such as an individual’s home address or phone number. Similarly, websites with user-generated content may allow the author to identify themself with an alias or username only. To find contact or customer service information for a website, start with the homepage. Look for a “contact us” or “customer service” link. Explore the website if you cannot find a “contact us” page. Sometimes you will find the contact information on a “corporate site” link or even on the company’s official social media page. Be a detective\! Note that different locales and different social media platforms may have their own conventions and standards for what information should be available on the website. Please use your judgment and knowledge of your locale.

### 3.0 Overall Page Quality Rating

## Now that you are an expert in understanding websites and webpages, here are the high-level steps of Page Quality rating:

1. ## Assess the true purpose of the page. If the website or page has a harmful purpose or is designed to deceive    people about its true purpose, it should be rated **Lowest**.

2. ## Assess the potential of the page to cause harm as described in these guidelines. Websites or pages that are    harmful to people or society, untrustworthy, or spammy as defined in these guidelines should be rated **Lowest**.

3. ## Otherwise, the PQ rating is based on how well the page achieves its purpose as described in these guidelines.    **Important** : There are harmful pages that are seemingly “official”, “expert”, or “authoritative”. Any type of website may    have pages with harmful MC, from user-uploaded videos and forum posts to harmful products sold online to pages to    pages that mimic the look of scientific papers or encyclopedia entries. All pages should be evaluated for harm—including    pages on government websites, academic institutions, reputable online stores, charities, or other types of generally helpful    websites.    On Page Quality rating tasks, you will use the Page Quality sliding scale (slider) to assign the overall PQ rating. The    slider looks like this:    You may also use the in-between ratings of **Lowest+** , **Low+** , **Medium+** , and **High+**. Please interpret the “+” as “+ ½,”    meaning that the **Lowest+** rating is halfway between **Lowest** and **Low** , **Low+** is halfway between **Low** and **Medium** , etc.    Identifying **Lowest** and **Low** quality pages can be the most difficult part of PQ rating. The guidance in the sections on    **Lowest** and **Low** is more extensive to help you rate accurately. **High** and **Highest** quality pages are typically easier to    identify, but be sure to apply the standards and examine the examples throughout these guidelines to help calibrate your    ratings. As might be expected, **Medium** quality pages are commonly found online.

#### 3.1 Page Quality Rating Considerations

## The following table summarizes the things that you should consider in Page Quality rating. Upcoming sections of these guidelines will elaborate on these considerations and explain how they apply to pages across the PQ rating scale. **Consideration Why it's Important for Page Quality Rating** The purpose of the page If the page has a harmful purpose, or if it is designed to deceive people about its true purpose or who is responsible for the content, it should be rated **Lowest**. Otherwise, PQ rating is the process of determining how well a page achieves its purpose. The potential for the page or website to cause harm as described in these guidelines Websites or pages that are harmful to people or society, untrustworthy, or spammy as described in these guidelines should be rated **Lowest**. The topic of the page and the extent to which that topic is YMYL The topic of the page helps determine the standards for your overall PQ assessment. Pages on YMYL topics have higher standards than pages on non-YMYL topics.

## **Consideration Why it's Important for Page Quality Rating** The type of website Different types of websites and webpages have different expectations for PQ rating. For example, PQ expectations may differ for: ● Small hobbyist websites vs. large corporate websites ● Websites involving financial transactions vs. websites that do not require payment or collect personal information ● Websites with content created by ordinary people on a volunteer basis vs. websites with content created by professionals Information provided by the website and content creator While the information that websites and content creators provide about themselves isn't always trustworthy, it can provide an important starting point. Quality of the MC Consider the extent to which the MC is satisfying and helps the page achieve its purpose. The title of the page The title of the page is considered part of the MC. Descriptive MC titles that summarize the page allow people to make informed decisions about what pages to visit. The role of Ads and SC on the page Consider the ways in which the Ads and SC contribute to how people experience the page. **Remember** : Many websites need monetization to share content with users. The presence or absence of Ads alone is not a consideration for PQ rating. Reputation of the website and content creator Research the reputation of the website and the content creator to learn about how others view the website and who is behind it. Trustworthiness of the page Assess how trustworthy the page is. Experience, Expertise and Authoritativeness can help with your assessment of Trust. Some types of pages require a high level of Trust. See Section 3.4 to learn more about Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trust. **Important** : These considerations overlap. For example, while examining the quality of the MC, you may notice factual inaccuracies that lower your assessment of Trust. While conducting reputation research, you may find information about the expertise of the content creator which increases your level of Trust. This is how PQ rating is designed to work\!

#### 3.2 Quality of the Main Content

## The quality of the Main Content (MC) is one of the most important considerations for PQ rating. The MC plays a major role in determining how well a page achieves its purpose. The unifying theme for evaluating the quality of the MC is the extent to which the MC allows the page to achieve its purpose and offers a satisfying user experience. For most pages, the quality of the MC can be determined by the amount of **effort** , **originality** , and **talent or skill** that went into the creation of the content. For informational pages and pages on YMYL topics, **accuracy** and consistency with well established expert consensus is important. **Effort** : Consider the extent to which a human being actively worked to create satisfying content. Effort may be direct, such as a person translating a poem from one language to another. Effort may go into designing page functionality or building systems that power a webpage, such as the creation of a page that offers machine translation as a service to users. On the other hand, the automatic creation of thousands of pages by running existing freely available content through existing translation software without any oversight, manual curation, etc., would not be considered to have effort. For pages like social media posts or forum discussions, the level of participation and depth of conversation is an important part of effort. Contributions from multiple individuals on such pages can add up to a significant amount of total human effort. **Originality** : Consider the extent to which the content offers unique, original content that is not available on other websites. If other websites have similar content, consider whether the page is the original source. **Talent or Skill** : Consider the extent to which the content is created with enough talent and skill to provide a satisfying experience for people who visit the page. **Accuracy** : For informational pages, consider the extent to which the content is factually accurate. For pages on YMYL topics, consider the extent to which the content is accurate and consistent with well-established expert consensus. The purpose of the page, topic of the page, and type of website all play a role in how to evaluate the quality of the MC. For example, consistency with well-established expert consensus is important for medical advice. Skill is important for how-to videos. Talent and originality is important for artistic expression. The amount of effort expected for a short video shared on social media is less than for a full-length, professionally produced documentary on a streaming video website, but both need sufficient effort to create satisfying content for their purpose. Think about what effort, originality, talent, or skill looks like for the type of page that you are evaluating. For each page you evaluate, spend a few minutes examining the MC before drawing a conclusion about it. Read the article, watch the video, examine the pictures, use the calculator, play the online game, etc. Remember that MC also includes page features and functionality, so test the page out. For example, if the page is a product page on a store website, put at least one product in the cart to make sure the shopping cart is functioning. If the page is an online game, try to play the game yourself. Do your best to imagine that you are someone who's very interested in the topic, functionality, or purpose served by the page, then think about how satisfying the MC would be for that person. High and low quality MC comes in all formats (e.g., text, audio, video, images) and all lengths (e.g., short-form videos and full-length professional documentaries). High and low quality content also exists on all types of websites, from small personal sites to large corporate sites, from forums and social media to websites that handle financial transactions. Think carefully about what helps the page achieve its purpose and what makes the MC satisfying for users.

#### 3.3 Reputation of the Website and Content Creators

## An important part of PQ rating is understanding the reputation of the website. If the website is not the primary creator of the MC, it’s important to research the reputation of the content creator as well. Reputation research should be performed according to the topic of the page. For example, if the page contains medical information, research the reputation of the website and content creator for providing medical information. It's possible for a website to be a go-to source for one type of content (e.g., humorous videos), but an untrustworthy source for a different type of content (e.g., financial information). A website's or content creator's reputation can also help you understand what a website or content creator is best known for. For example, newspapers may be known for high quality, independent investigative reporting while satire websites may be known for their humor. An individual journalist (content creator) may be known for the clarity of their scientific articles while a food blogger (content creator) may be known for the deliciousness of the recipes they post online. Note that a company or person may create content on many different websites. For example, a newspaper might have their own website, upload their video content to a video sharing website, post updates on social media, and contribute content to a TV channel. An expert on a topic might publish research papers, have a lengthy blog, and share short updates on social media. In these cases, you should research the underlying company or content creator. Reputation research is especially important for detecting untrustworthy websites and content creators. Content may look great on the surface, but reputation research can expose scams, fraud, or other signs of harm. You never know what you will find unless you look\! Therefore, reputation research is required for all PQ rating tasks.

##### 3.3.1 Reputation of the Website

## A website's reputation is based on the experience of real users and the opinions of people who are experts. Websites may represent real companies, organizations, and other entities. Reputation research applies to both the website and the actual company, organization, or entity that the website is representing. Many websites are eager to tell users how great they are. Your job is to independently evaluate the Page Quality of the website, not just accept information that appears on one or two pages of the website without further verification. Be skeptical of claims that websites make about themselves, particularly when there is a clear conflict of interest. Instead, look for independent reviews, references, recommendations by experts, news articles, and other sources of credible information about the website. Look for information written by a person or organization, not statistics or other machine-compiled information. News articles, Wikipedia articles, blog posts, magazine articles, forum discussions, and ratings from independent organizations can all be great sources of reputation information. For YMYL topics, the reputation of a website should be judged by what experts in the field have to say. Recommendations from expert sources, such as professional societies, are strong evidence of a positive reputation. Sources of reputation information will also vary according to the topic or type of company/organization/entity that the website represents. For example, you might find that a newspaper (with an associated website) has won journalistic awards. Prestigious awards or a history of high-quality original reporting are strong evidence of positive reputation for news websites. Note that some types of information about a website is not related to its reputation. For example, websites like Similarweb have information about Internet traffic to the website, but do not provide evidence of positive or negative reputation. You can ignore this type of information since it's not helpful for PQ rating.

##### 3.3.2 Customer Reviews as Reputation Information

## Customer reviews can be helpful for assessing the reputation of a store, business, or any website that offers products or services to users. You may consider a large number of detailed, trustworthy, positive user reviews as evidence of positive reputation for a store or business. However, you should interpret customer reviews with care, particularly if there are only a few. Keep the following in mind: ● **Be skeptical of both positive and negative reviews.** Anyone can write them, including the website owner or someone whom the store or business hires for this purpose. ● **Try to find as many reviews as possible.** Any store or business can get a few negative reviews—this is completely normal and expected. Large stores and companies receive thousands of reviews, and most receive some negative ones. ● **Read the reviews because the content of the reviews matter, not just the number or star rating.** Credible, convincing reports of fraud and financial wrongdoing is evidence of extremely negative reputation. On the other hand, a single encounter with a rude clerk or the delayed receipt of a single package should not be considered negative reputation information. Please use your judgment.

##### 3.3.3 How to Search for Reputation Information about a Website

## Here is how to research the reputation of the website:

1. ## Identify the “homepage” of the website. For example, for the IBM website, ibm.com is the homepage. You may    need to identify the content creator, if it is different from that of the overall website.

2. ## Using ibm.com as an example, try one or more of the following searches on Google:    ● \[ibm \-site:ibm.com\] \- A search for IBM that excludes pages on ibm.com.    ● \[“ibm.com” \-site:ibm.com\] \- A search for “ibm.com” that excludes pages on ibm.com.    ● \[ibm reviews \-site:ibm.com\] \- A search for reviews of IBM that excludes pages on ibm.com.    ● \[“ibm.com” reviews \-site:ibm.com\] \- A search for reviews of “ibm.com” that excludes pages on ibm.com.    **Note** : When searching for reputation information, try to find sources that were not written or created by the    website or the company itself. For example, IBM might have official social media pages that it closely maintains,    which would not be considered independent sources of reputation information about the company. See here for a    Wikipedia article on identifying and using independent sources.

3. ## Look for articles, references, recommendations by experts, and other credible information written by people about    the website.    High quality news articles and informational articles may be good sources of reputation information. Search for    such articles. For example, try \[ibm site:en.wikipedia.org\]. News articles and informational articles can help you    learn about a company and may include information specific to reputation, such as awards and other forms of    recognition, or also controversies and issues. Note that some informational articles include a message warning    users that there are disagreements on some of the content, or that the content may be outdated. This may be an    indication that additional research is necessary.

4. ## Make sure the information you find is appropriate for judging the reputation of the website. For example,    reputation information for YMYL topics should come from sources that have expertise in the associated YMYL    topic.

## Here are some examples of reputation information: **Website Reputation Information About the Website Description** annualcreditreport.com Search results for \[annualcreditreport.com \-site:annualcreditreport.com\] Wikipedia article about annualcreditreport.com Reputable article about annualcreditreport.com **Positive reputation information** : Users in the U.S. can obtain free credit reports on this website by providing their Social Security Number. Note that the Wikipedia article tells us that “AnnualCreditReport.com is the only federally mandated and authorized source for obtaining a free credit report.” clevelandclinic.org Search results for \[clevelandclinic.org\] Wikipedia article about clevelandclinic.org Reputable article about the best hospitals in the U.S. **Positive reputation information** : According to Wikipedia, the Cleveland Clinic “is currently regarded as one of the top 4 hospitals in the United States” which can be confirmed by reputable news articles cited in the references section. Users can trust medical information on this website. csmonitor.com Search results for \[csmonitor.com \-site:csmonitor.com\] Wikipedia article about The Christian Science Monitor **Positive reputation information** : Notice the highlighted section in the Wikipedia article about The Christian Science Monitor newspaper, which tells us that the newspaper has won several prestigious awards. From this information, it can be inferred that the csmonitor.com website has a positive reputation. kernel.org Search results for \[kernel.org –site:kernel.org\] Wikipedia article about kernel.org **Positive reputation information** : According to the Wikipedia article, “Kernel.org is a main repository of source code for the Linux kernel, the base of the popular Linux operating system. It makes all versions of the source code available to all users. It also hosts various other projects, like Google Android. The main purpose of the site is to host a repository for Linux kernel developers.” Site selling children’s jungle gym Search to find reputation information Search to find reviews Negative review on a business review page 1 Negative review on a business review page 2 Negative news article **Extremely negative reputation information** : This website appears to be a perfectly fine-looking store; however, much evidence of negative reputation can be found. The business has a very low rating on a business review site. There is a news article about financial fraud. There are many reviews on different websites describing users sending money and not receiving anything. Site selling products related to eyewear Search to find reputation information Negative review on a business review page Wikipedia article Article about business' criminal behavior **Extremely negative/malicious reputation** **information** : This website engaged in criminal behavior such as physically threatening users. Organization serving the hospitalized veteran community Negative review 1 Negative review 2 Negative review 3 Negative review 4 **Extremely negative reputation information** : There are many detailed negative articles on news sites and charity watchdog sites about this organization describing fraud and financial mishandling.

##### 3.3.4 Reputation of the Content Creators

## For individual authors and content creators, biographical information articles and online discussions can be a good source of reputation information. Expect to find more formal reputation information about people who create content in a journalistic, scientific, academic, or other traditionally professional capacity, as they often need online credibility for professional success. Educational degrees, peer validation, expert co-authors, and citations can be evidence of positive reputation information for professionals who publish their work. Employment history can also support a positive reputation for topics where training, credentials, or experience are important. Influencers and other individual content creators who earn income on social media platforms often have reputation information available as well, ranging from from biographical details or news articles to less formal reputation sources such as comments by other influencers in their fields. For non-professional content creators including ordinary people who post on social media or forums, you may find informal reputation information on the page itself such as comments by other people about the creators. For example, you may find comments or posts from other users helpful to see what other people think about a particular content creator.

##### 3.3.5 What to Do When You Find No Reputation Information

## You should expect to find some reputation information for large websites and well-known content creators. People or businesses who create content in a professional capacity typically have some reputation information available. However, small websites may have little or no reputation information. This is not indicative of high or low quality. Many small local businesses or community organizations have a small “web presence” and rely on word of mouth. Furthermore, many ordinary people participate in forum discussions or post on social media websites in a personal capacity. People may use an alias or username to post in order to avoid sharing personally identifiable information online. There may be no reputation information available for some individuals. A lack of reputation about people who post personal content is neither a positive nor a negative sign in your assessment of the page. Finally, remember that there are several important considerations involved in PQ rating (refer back to Section 3.1 ). Reputation is important, but if reputation information is not available for a website or content creator, pay extra attention to other PQ considerations, especially when assessing pages on YMYL topics.

#### 3.4 Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trust (E-E-A-T)

## Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trust (E-E-A-T) are all important considerations in PQ rating. The most important member at the center of the E-E-A-T family is Trust. **Trust** : Consider the extent to which the page is accurate, honest, safe, and reliable. The type and amount of **Trust** needed depends on the page, for example: ● **Online stores** need secure online payment systems and reliable customer service. ● **Product reviews** should be honest and written to help others make informed purchasing decisions (rather than solely to sell the product). ● **Informational pages on clear YMYL topics** must be accurate to prevent harm to people and society. ● **Social media posts on non-YMYL topics** may not need a high level of Trust, such as when the purpose of the post is to entertain its audience and the content of the post does not risk causing harm. **Experience** , **Expertise** and **Authoritativeness** are important concepts that can support your assessment of Trust: **Experience** : Consider the extent to which the content creator has the necessary first-hand or life experience for the topic. Many types of pages are trustworthy and achieve their purpose well when created by people with a wealth of personal experience. For example, which would you trust: a product review from someone who has personally used the product or a "review" by someone who has not? **Expertise** : Consider the extent to which the content creator has the necessary knowledge or skill for the topic. Different topics require different levels and types of expertise to be trustworthy. For example, which would you trust: home electrical rewiring advice from a skilled electrician or from an antique homes enthusiast who has no knowledge of electrical wiring? **Authoritativeness:** Consider the extent to which the content creator or the website is known as a go-to source for the topic. While most topics do not have one official, Authoritative website or content creator, when they do, that website or content creator is often among the most reliable and trustworthy sources. For example, a local business profile page on social media may be the authoritative and trusted source for what is on sale now. The official government page for getting a passport is the unique, official, and authoritative source for passport renewal. **Experience** , **Expertise** , and **Authoritativeness** may overlap for some page types and topics (for example, someone may develop Expertise in a topic due to first-hand Experience accumulated over time), and different combinations of E-E-A may be relevant to different topics. You should consider the purpose, type, and topic of the page, then ask yourself what would make the content creator a trustworthy source in that context.

## **Trust** is the most important member of the E-E-A-T family because untrustworthy pages have low E-E-A-T no matter how Experienced, Expert, or Authoritative they may seem. For example, a financial scam is untrustworthy, even if the content creator is a highly experienced and expert scammer who is considered the go-to on running scams\! When it comes to Page Quality rating, your assessment of E-E-A-T should be informed by one or more of the following: ● **What the website or content creators say about themselves:** Look at the "About us" page on the website or profile page of the content creator as a starting point. Is the website or content creator a trustworthy source based on this information? ● **What others say about the website or content creators:** Look for independent reviews, references, news articles, and other sources of credible information about the website or content creators. Is there independent, reliable evidence that the website or content creator is experienced, has expertise, is authoritative, or is otherwise considered trustworthy? Is there independent, reliable evidence that the website or creator is untrustworthy? ● **What is visible on the page, including the Main Content and sections such as reviews and comments:** For some types of pages, the level of experience and expertise may be clear from the MC itself. What evidence can you gather from examining the MC or testing the page out? For example, you may be able to tell that someone is an expert in hair styling by watching a video of them in action (styling someone's hair) and reading others' comments (commenters often highlight expertise or lack thereof). **Important** : The website or content creator may not be a trustworthy source if there is a clear conflict of interest. For example, product reviews by people who own the product and share their experiences can be very valuable and trustworthy. However, "reviews" by the product manufacturer ( *"Our product is great\!"* ) or "reviews" from an influencer who is paid to promote the product are not as trustworthy due to the conflict of interest. Finally, there are many aspects of Trust, some which are not captured by Experience, Expertise and Authoritativeness. Please consider other aspects in your overall Trust assessment, such as customer service information for online stores or peer-reviewed publications for academic authors. If a page is untrustworthy for any reason *,* it has low E-E-A-T.

##### 3.4.1 YMYL Topics: Experience or Expertise?

## Pages on YMYL topics can be created for a wide variety of different purposes. If the purpose of a page on a clear YMYL topic is to give information or offer advice, a high level of expertise may be required for the page to be trustworthy. However, sometimes pages on YMYL topics are created to share personal experiences, often regarding difficult life challenges. People turn to each other in times of need to share their own experience, seek comfort or inspiration, and learn from others. Factual information from experts and authoritative sources may not satisfy this need. Pages that share first-hand life experience on clear YMYL topics may be considered to have high E-E-A-T as long as the content is trustworthy, safe, and consistent with well-established expert consensus. In contrast, some types of YMYL information and advice must come from experts. Here are some examples: **YMYL Topic** Valuable sharing of life **Experience** Information or advice best left to **Experts** Sleep challenges when pregnant *(YMYL Health or Safety)* Safe and non-medical tips and tricks for sleeping in the last trimester of pregnancy, provided by people who have personally struggled with this challenge, for example: how to use pillows to sleep comfortably in a position that is safe for babies Sleep medications that are safe during pregnancy Liver cancer treatment *(YMYL Health or Safety)* A sincere and respectful forum discussion where people are describing how they're coping with liver cancer treatment Different treatment options for liver cancer and the associated life expectancies under each treatment Filling out tax forms *(YMYL Financial Security)* A humorous video from a non-expert content creator about the frustration of doing taxes Instructions on how to fill out tax forms Saving for retirement *(YMYL Financial Security)* Reviews of retirement saving services by people with first-hand experience using these services Advice on how to invest for retirement: how much to save, what kinds of assets to invest in, how much money you will need to retire by a specific age, etc. How to vote *(YMYL Society)* A social media post by an ordinary citizen describing why they personally believe it's important to vote in local elections Information about who is eligible to vote or how to register to vote

### 4.0 Lowest Quality Pages

## **Lowest** quality pages are untrustworthy, deceptive, harmful to people or society, or have other highly undesirable characteristics. The considerations for **Lowest** quality include quality of the MC, reputation, E-E-A-T, etc., but there are special checks you will need to complete first. As a reminder, here are the steps for doing PQ rating:

1. ## Assess the true purpose of the page. If the website or page has a harmful purpose or is designed to deceive    people about its true purpose, it should be rated **Lowest**.

2. ## Assess the potential of the page to cause harm as described in these guidelines. Websites or pages that are    harmful to people or society, untrustworthy, or spammy as specified in these guidelines should receive the    **Lowest** rating.

3. ## Otherwise, the PQ rating is based on how well the page achieves its purpose using the criteria outlined in these    guidelines.    Steps 1 and 2 are a screening process to quickly detect harmful content before other PQ considerations are applied.    To identify **Lowest** quality pages, start by considering the following:    Initial Consideration **Lowest** Quality Pages    The purpose of the page **The Lowest rating is required** if the page has a harmful purpose, or if    it is designed to deceive people about its true purpose or who is    responsible for the content on the page.    **The Lowest rating is required** if the page is created to benefit the    owner of the website (e.g. to make money) with very little or no attempt    to benefit website visitors or otherwise serve a beneficial purpose.    The potential for the page to cause harm as    described in these guidelines    **The Lowest rating is required** if the MC is harmful to self or others,    harmful to specified groups, or contains harmfully misleading    information.    The topic of the page, the type of website, and    the extent to which YMYL standards apply    A page on any topic or any type of website may qualify for **Lowest.**    Give special scrutiny to pages or websites needing a high level of    trust, such as online stores, medical websites, or news coverage of    major civic issues.

## Next, assess the page to determine if any of the criteria for **Lowest** apply: **Lowest** Page Quality Assessment Any one of the following is justification for **Lowest** Quality of the MC ● The page is hacked, defaced, or spammed. ● The page is gibberish or otherwise makes no sense. ● The MC is created with little to no effort, has little to no originality and the MC adds no value compared to similar pages on the web. ● The MC is created with so little effort, originality, talent, or skill that the page fails to achieve its purpose. The title of the page The page title is extremely misleading, shocking, or exaggerated. The role of Ads and SC on the page The MC is deliberately obstructed or obscured due to Ads, SC, interstitial pages, download links or other content that is beneficial to the website owner but not necessarily the website visitor. Information provided by the website and content creator A complete lack of information about who is responsible for the website and its content for YMYL pages or other pages requiring trust. Reputation of the website and content creator A very negative reputation, including a reputation for malicious or harmful behavior. Trustworthiness of the page: E-E-A-T ● The page or website is highly untrustworthy. ● The lack of experience, expertise, authoritativeness or trust causes the page to fail to achieve its purpose.

#### 4.1 Types of Lowest Quality Pages

## There are many different shapes and forms that **Lowest** pages can take. To help you keep track, the table below organizes **Lowest** pages into three broad categories: Harmful, Untrustworthy, and Spammy. These categories can overlap (e.g., pages that contain Harmfully Misleading Information are also Untrustworthy). Type of **Lowest** Page **Description Reference Section** Harmful to Self or Other Individuals Pages that encourage, depict, incite or directly cause physical, mental, emotional or financial harm to self or other individuals. Examples include: ● Detailed instructions on how to commit suicide ● Detailed, realistic, and serious instructions written with the intent to help someone commit murder Section 4.2 Harmful to Specified Groups Pages that promote, condone, or incite violence or hatred against a Specified Group of people (as defined in Section 4.3). Examples include: ● Content that encourages violence or ill treatment towards a Specified Group ● Content with extremely offensive/dehumanizing stereotypes of a Specified Group Section 4.3 Harmfully Misleading Information Pages that misinform people in a way that could cause harm. Examples include: ● Clearly inaccurate harmful information that can easily be refuted by straightforward and widely accepted facts ● Harmful unsubstantiated theories/claims not grounded in any reasonable facts or evidence Section 4.4 Untrustworthy Webpages Pages or websites that are deceptive or have untrustworthy characteristics. Examples include: ● Pages or websites with deceptive purpose or design ● Pages or websites designed to manipulate people into actions that benefit the website or other organization while causing harm to self, others or Specified Groups Section 4.5 Spammy Webpages Pages with characteristics of webspam as defined in the Google Search Essentials Guidelines and/or Section 4.6 of these guidelines. Examples include: ● Pages deliberately created with no MC or gibberish MC ● Hacked, defaced, or spammed pages Section 4.6 **Important** : There is lots of content that many people would find controversial, one-sided, off-putting, or distasteful, yet does not meet the criteria for **Lowest** as described in these guidelines. Use your judgment to follow the standards outlined throughout Section 4.0 rather than relying on personal opinions.

#### 4.2 Harmful to Self or Other Individuals

## Use the **Lowest** rating for pages with content that encourages, depicts, incites, or directly causes harm to self or other individuals. Harm includes physical, mental, emotional, or financial harm to people. Pages should be considered Harmful to Self or Other Individuals if they directly attempt to harm people; encourage behavior that may result in harm; depict extremely violent or gory content without a beneficial/educational purpose; or otherwise are severely traumatic to people who view the page. Pages do not have to be harmful to *all* people to be considered Harmful to Self or Other Individuals. Different people have different levels of vulnerability to scams, awareness of potential dangers (e.g., dangerous feats depicted in stunt videos), and tolerance for viewing violent/disturbing content. If there is a reasonable possibility that viewing a particular page would cause harm to those who are most vulnerable, it should be considered harmful**.** Pages created with a beneficial purpose that report on, discuss, or inform about harmful actions or events (e.g., fictional entertainment, reputable news, education) should typically not be considered Harmful to Self or Other Individuals. For example, advocacy aimed at drawing attention to harmful, real-world actions or events (such as a webpage describing a protest against domestic violence) would not be considered Harmful to Self or Other Individuals. Here are some examples of content that is vs. is not considered Harmful to Self or Other Individuals: **Harmful to Self or Other Individuals NOT Harmful to Self or Other Individuals** ● Incitement of violence towards Other Individuals ● Serious death threats or realistic-sounding threats ● Exposing personal information belonging to others with malicious intent to target them or promote harassment towards them (i.e., “doxxing”) ● How-to information that describes how to commit violent acts in an easy-to-replicate way ● Advocating for, glorifying, or trivializing violence and atrocities, or to disparage victim(s) of violence/atrocities ● Depicting or promoting information that facilitates or leads to serious harm to people, or discussions that attempt to justify abuse of people ● Encouraging unsafe behavior or substantially downplays the risks of dangerous activities (e.g., consuming household cleaning products) ● Suicide promotion or pro-anorexia content that encourages people to engage in behavior that can result in hospitalization or death ● Health-related advice that contradicts well-established expert consensus and could result in serious harm or could prevent someone from undertaking a life-saving treatment ● Depictions of violence in an action movie ● A news story about violent events ● Educational content that may depict violence or gross imagery ● An explanation of scams meant to raise awareness about them ● Portrayals of dangerous activities in a manner that discourages others from attempting the same feat (such as by clearly explaining the risks, describing the expertise and equipment required, etc.)

#### 4.3 Harmful to Specified Groups

## Use the **Lowest** rating for pages that promote, condone, or incite hatred against a Specified Group of people. For the purposes of Search Quality rating, a Specified Group is a group of people that can be defined on the basis of: ● Age (e.g., older adults) ● Caste (e.g., Dalits) ● Disability (e.g., people who are blind) ● Ethnicity (e.g., Roma) ● Gender Identity and Expression (e.g., transgender people) ● Immigration Status (e.g., student visa holders) ● Nationality (e.g., Italians) ● Race (e.g., Asians) ● Religion (e.g., Christians) ● Sex/Gender (e.g., men) ● Sexual Orientation (e.g., lesbians) ● Veteran Status (e.g., Marines) ● Victims of a major violent event and their kin (e.g., victims of the Holocaust) ● Any other characteristic that is associated with systemic discrimination or marginalization (e.g., refugees, people experiencing homelessness) The tone of the harmful content must be either serious (i.e., not joking or satirical) or mean-spirited (i.e., with an intent to demean or promote intolerance) to be considered Harmful to Specified Groups. Comedy or artistic expression related to a Specified Group should not be considered harmful unless it is clearly mean-spirited or has other clear harmful impact. Criticism of objects, philosophies, and ideas are generally not considered Harmful to Specified Groups. For example, negative criticism of a religious doctrine should not be considered targeted at the Specified Group that follows that religion. Remember that the content must promote, condone, or incite hatred of *people* to be considered Harmful to Specified Groups. Educational pages (e.g., definitions, research, academic papers), news stories, or other pages that have a beneficial purpose of informing society should not be considered Harmful to Specified Groups. Similarly, historical documents/videos that aim to capture the beliefs of different eras should not be considered Harmful to Specified Groups. Here are some examples of content that is vs. is not considered Harmful to Specified Groups: **Harmful to Specified Groups NOT Harmful to Specified Groups** ● Encourages violence or ill treatment towards a Specified Group ● Promotes intolerance by demonstrating a staunch unwillingness to allow for the views, beliefs, or behavior of a Specified Group ● Implies that one Specified Group is superior or inferior to another ● Contains extremely offensive/dehumanizing stereotypes of a Specified Group. Note that stereotypes can be negative or positive. ● A historical documentary of WWII featuring speeches from Nazi leaders ● A stand-up comedy routine that plays off of stereotypes in a way that is not mean-spirited ● A newspaper article about a hate organization ● The dictionary definition of a slur ● A discussion about a particular religious text and its views on women

#### 4.4 Harmfully Misleading Information

## Use the **Lowest** rating for pages that mislead people in ways that can cause harm to people and society. Misleading pages may have been produced with the intent to misinform people, or the content creator may believe that the inaccurate information they are sharing is true. There is an especially high standard for accuracy on clear YMYL topics or other topics where inaccurate information can cause harm. Be sure to research consequential facts or claims as necessary and to the extent the task time allows. Pages should be considered to contain Harmfully Misleading Information when they contain *at least one of the following:* **Type of Harmfully** **Misleading Information** **Description Examples** Harmful and clearly inaccurate information Content that can be refuted by straightforward and widely accepted facts ● False claims that a world leader died ● False dates for an election Harmful claims that contradict well-established expert consensus Content that is inconsistent with positions, facts, or findings that are widely agreed upon by authorities in the relevant field ● Claims that lemons cure cancer ● Claims that buying lottery tickets is a guaranteed way to save for retirement Harmful unsubstantiated theories/claims Content that is not grounded in any reasonable facts or evidence, especially those that could erode confidence in public institutions. This includes unsubstantiated theories that have been thoroughly debunked or are too outlandish to be given credence. ● Claims that the 9-11 attacks were planned by the U.S. government ● Claims that world leaders are lizard people Harmfully Misleading Information can occur from any websites or content creators \- even seemingly "expert", "authoritative" or "official" ones. Any type of page with Harmfully Misleading Information should be rated Lowest, regardless of the source. However, note that some types of information are subjective, debatable, unverifiable, or inconsequential. For example, pages should not be considered to contain Harmfully Misleading Information if they *exclusively* contain: ● Non-YMYL content created with a clear entertainment purpose, containing no hard claims of factual accuracy and are not harmful to people or society. Examples include many types of fiction, satire or parody, astrology, folklore, myths, and urban legends. ● Reviews expressing personal preferences, opinions, or value-based judgments about a product, restaurant, book/movie/TV show, etc. ● Claims or statements that are reasonably debatable when there is not a single established correct answer or truth (e.g., discussions about the relative effectiveness of different healthcare systems) ● Insignificant errors or inaccurate information about a trivial topic (e.g., inaccuracies in the height of a celebrity) Pages that aim to persuade others that a certain position or perspective is correct are fairly common on the Internet. Pages with one-sided/opinionated/controversial/polarizing content should not be considered to contain Harmfully Misleading Information unless they could create harm to individuals or Specified Groups (as described above) and contain clearly inaccurate information, contradict well-established expert consensus, or are not grounded by reasonable facts/evidence. A webpage may be considered to have Harmfully Misleading Information based on the MC or on other characteristics of the page or information about the content creator (e.g., the title of an article is harmfully misleading, even if the article on its own is not; a creator blatantly misrepresenting their medical credentials for a video on medical topics). Harmfully Misleading Information can be especially hard to identify because it may require research from outside sources. Reputable fact-checking websites can't always keep up with the volume of unsubstantiated theories/claims produced by

## the Internet, and some theories may even claim that debunking information is inaccurate. You should attempt to find high-quality, trustworthy sources to check accuracy and seek out the consensus of experts if you are unsure. Please research theories and claims to the extent the task time allows. If a theory/claim seems wildly improbable and can't be verified by independent trustworthy sources, you should consider it unsubstantiated.

#### 4.5 Untrustworthy Webpages or Websites

## The **Lowest** rating should be used for pages or websites you strongly suspect are engaging in deceptive or malicious practices. Some untrustworthy pages are created to benefit the website or organization rather than helping people. Some untrustworthy pages may even exist to cause harm to people who engage with the page, such as scams or malicious downloads. Your assessment of untrustworthiness may be based on the content of the page, information about the website, information about the content creator, and the reputation of the website or content creator. Your assessment may also be based on a *lack* of critically important information. For example, any website involving financial transactions or sensitive information should have comprehensive information about who is responsible for the site and a way to contact the site if something goes wrong. If some aspect of a page or website makes you suspect deception or maliciousness, please look for information about the site. If you cannot find reputation information to confirm your suspicion, carefully explore the site. Sometimes a single page on an unknown website in isolation may seem odd but subsequent exploration shows no concern. However, if you see a pattern of what appears to be deception or manipulation or become concerned about your own safety, please use the **Lowest** rating and leave the website immediately. Pages with the following characteristics should be considered Untrustworthy: ● Multiple or significant factual inaccuracies on an informational page which would cause users to lose trust in the webpage as a reliable source of information ● Inadequate information about the website or content creator for its purpose ● Lowest E-E-A-T or Lowest reputation ● Deceptive purpose, deceptive page design, or deceptive intent ● Deliberately obstructed or obscured MC ● Characteristics of scams, malicious downloads, or other harmful behavior ● Any webpage or website designed to manipulate people into actions that benefit the website or other organization while causing harm to self, others, or Specified Groups **Important** : Highly untrustworthy pages should be given the **Lowest** rating even if you are unable to "prove" the webpage or site is harmful. Because many people are unwilling to use a highly untrustworthy page, an untrustworthy page or website fails to achieve its purpose.

##### 4.5.1 Inadequate Information about the Website or Content Creator for the Purpose of the Page

## For pages that require a high level of trust, information about who created the content and who is responsible for the content is critical. As discussed in Section 2.5.3 , we expect most websites to have some information about who (e.g., what individual, company, business, foundation, etc.) is responsible for the website and who created the MC and some contact information, unless there is a good reason for anonymity. As you will see in the examples below, many types of **Lowest** pages such as malicious downloads and scams typically have no information or fake information about who is responsible to prevent recourse by people who are harmed.

## Any site that handles personal, private or sensitive data must provide extensive contact information. This includes sites that ask users to create passwords, share personal information, or conduct financial transactions. YMYL pages or websites that handle sensitive data with absolutely no information about the website or content creator should be rated **Lowest**.

##### 4.5.2 Lowest E-E-A-T and Lowest Reputation of the Website or Content Creator

## If the E-E-A-T of a page is low enough, people cannot or should not use the MC of the page. If a page on YMYL topics is highly inexpert, it should be considered Untrustworthy and rated **Lowest**. Use the **Lowest** rating if the website and content creator have an extremely negative reputation, to the extent that many people would consider the webpage or website untrustworthy. Here are some examples originally shown in Section 3.3.3. All pages on these websites should be rated **Lowest** because of the credible extremely negative or malicious reputation of these websites, making them untrustworthy. **Note** : These website examples may be considered Harmful in some form as well. Sometimes reputation research exposes information that may not meet the criteria for considering a website harmful but does cause it to be untrustworthy. **Website Description** Site selling children’s jungle gym **Evidence of fraudulent behavior** : There are many reviews on websites describing how users sent money and did not receive anything in return. There is also a news article about this business engaging in financial fraud. Site selling products related to eyewear **Evidence of criminal behavior** : This website engaged in criminal behavior such as physically threatening users. Organization serving the hospitalized veteran community **Evidence of fraudulent behavior** : There are many detailed negative articles on news sites and charity watchdog sites describing fraud and financial mishandling about this organization.

##### 4.5.3 Deceptive Page Purpose, Deceptive Information about the Website, Deceptive Design

## All pages or websites using deception of any type should be rated **Lowest** because they are Untrustworthy. Here are some types of deception to look for during Page Quality rating. **Type of Deception Description** **Deceptive Purpose** The page or the website superficially appear to have one purpose, but in fact exist for a different reason. **Deceptive Information about** **the Website or Content** **Creators** The website has deliberately inaccurate or misleading information about the website or content creators to make the website appear trustworthy. **Deceptive Design** The page or content is deliberately designed to look like one type of page or content but in fact functions as another. **Note** : No list of deceptive page types will be complete—deceptive websites continue to evolve as people and search engines figure out how they are being tricked.

## Please see below for some examples. Deceptive purpose: ● **A webpage with deliberately inaccurate information to promote products in order to make money from** **clicks on monetized links.** Examples include a product recommendation page on a website falsely impersonating a celebrity blog, or a product recommendation based on a false claim of personal, independent testing when no such testing was conducted. ● **A webpage claims to offer an independent review or share other information about a product, but is in** **fact created to make money for the owner of the website without attempting to help users.** For example, the MC may contain intentionally misleading or inaccurate information created with the sole purpose of getting users to click on monetized links or buy the product. Deceptive information about the website or content creators: ● **A webpage or website that impersonates a different site** (e.g., copied logo or branding of an unaffiliated site, URL that mimics another site's name, etc.) **● A non-satirical social network profile made by an impersonator**. ● **A webpage or website that looks like a news source or information page, but in fact has articles to** **manipulate users** in order to benefit a person, business, government, or other organization politically, monetarily, or otherwise. ● **A website claims to be the personal website of a celebrity, but the website is actually created to make** **money for the owner of the website without the permission of the celebrity.** For example, the page may have false testimonials for a product and is created for the sole purpose of getting users to click on monetized links or buy the product. ● **A webpage or website with deceptive business information.** For example, a website may claim to have a physical "brick and mortar" store but in fact only exists online. While there is nothing wrong with being an online business, claiming to have a physical "brick and mortar" (e.g. fake photo, fake physical store address) is deceptive. ● **A webpage or website with "fake" owner or content creator profiles.** For example, AI generated content with made up "author" profiles (AI generated images or deceptive creator descriptions) in order to make it appear that the content is written by people. ● **Factually inaccurate and deceptive information about creator expertise.** For example, an author or creator profile inaccurately claims to have credentials or expertise (e.g. the content creator claims falsely to be a medical professional) to make the content appear more trustworthy than it is. Deceptive design: ● **Pages that disguise Ads as MC**. Actual MC may be minimal or created to encourage users to click on the Ads. For example, fake search pages ( example ) that have a list of links that look like a page of search results. If you click on a few of the links, you will see that the page is just a collection of Ads disguised as search engine results. A “search box” is present, but submitting a new query just gives you a different page of Ads disguised as search results. ● **Pages that disguise Ads as website navigation links**. For example, fake directory pages ( example ) that look like a personally curated set of helpful links, possibly with unique descriptions. In reality, the links are Ads or links to other similar pages on the site. Sometimes the descriptions of the links are unrelated to the page. ● **Pages with deceptively designed buttons or links**. For example, buttons or links on pop ups, interstitials or on the page are designed to look like they do one thing (such as close a pop up) but in fact have a different result which most people would not expect, e.g. download an app. ● **Pages with a misleading title or a title that has nothing to do with the content on the page.** People who come to the page expecting content related to the title will feel tricked or deceived. Take a good look at the page and use your judgment. If you believe the true purpose of the page is not what it appears to be, the page should be rated **Lowest.** If you believe the page was deliberately created with the primary purpose to manipulate users to click on Ads, monetized links, questionable download links, etc., rather than to help people, the page

## should be rated **Lowest.** If the website has any form of deceptive or significantly misleading information about itself, or if the page or website uses deception in any form even if not described here, the page should be rated **Lowest.**

##### 4.5.4 Deliberately Obstructed or Obscured MC

## Pages are untrustworthy if the MC is deliberately obstructed or obscured due to Ads, SC, interstitial pages, download links or other content that is beneficial to the website owner but not necessarily the website visitor. Attempts to manipulate or coerce users away from the MC is evidence of untrustworthiness. Here are some examples of pages with deliberately obstructed or obscured MC that should be rated **Lowest** : ● Ads that continue to cover the MC as the website visitor scrolls down the page. The Ads are virtually impossible to close without clicking on the Ad ● Pop-ups that obscure the MC and cannot be closed without taking an action that benefits the website ● An interstitial page that attempts to coerce a download or click that does not benefit the website visitor ● Ads that push the MC down so far that many users would not notice the MC ● MC in white-on-white text or MC presented so that it is difficult for a human being to read Logins or paywalls on otherwise trustworthy sites should not be considered untrustworthy, deceptive, or coercive. Many high quality sites such as newspapers or magazines cannot exist without monetization through subscriptions and paywalls. Some types of MC should be login protected, such as pages with personal information online banking websites or private pages on social network websites. MC may be inaccessible for non-deliberate or non-coercive reasons, such as content that doesn't load or content that is unavailable in a country or region. These are not reasons for **Lowest**. Use your judgment to assess whether the page is designed to manipulate or coerce users into taking actions that benefit the website. If you are unsure, look at other pages on the same website, conduct reputation research, etc. **Important:** Remember that many websites need monetization to share content with users. The presence of Ads alone is not enough for **Lowest**.

##### 4.5.5 Suspected Malicious Behavior

## It may be difficult to prove that a page causes harm without experiencing harm yourself. For this reason, you may use the **Lowest** rating if you strongly suspect a page is malicious or harmful even without having proof. Any of the following should be considered untrustworthy: ● Pages or websites that you strongly suspect are scams (see these links for more information about Internet scams: Avoid Scams 1 , Avoid Scams 2 , Internet Fraud ). ● Pages that ask for personal information without a legitimate reason (for example, pages that ask for name, birthdate, address, bank account, government ID number, etc.). ● Pages that appear to “phish” for passwords to Facebook, Gmail, or other popular online services. See here for information about “phishing” fraud. ● Pages with links that you strongly suspect are malware downloads. **Important** : Do not continue to interact with the page if you observe these characteristics. If you do click on a link and encounter a malware warning from your browser or antivirus software ( example ), please do not continue to that page. You can assume that the page is malicious for the purpose of rating and use **Lowest**. Note that not all warnings your browser may display are related to malware (e.g., other types of browser warnings include certificate acceptance requests, content filtering warnings, etc.). If you are unsure or hesitant to continue to the page for any reason, you can release the task.

#### 4.6 Spammy Webpages

## Pages and websites should exist for the benefit of people who visit the website. There are many types of webpages that can benefit visitors, such as online shopping or banking services, videos offering entertainment, or personal pages sharing a perspective or experience. Some of these pages depend on advertising and monetization to maintain the website and create high quality content while still benefiting visitors. However, some pages are created to benefit the website owner or other organizations and with little to no attention paid to the experience of the people who visit. When such pages use deceptive techniques to appear near the top of search results, it may disincentivize the creation of high quality content by crowding out pages created with effort, originality, talent, or skill that is helpful for visitors. This section describes characteristics of spam or spam-like pages that should be rated **Lowest**. The Google Search Web Spam Policies page is a good reference to learn more about different spam techniques. If you recognize any of these spam techniques on a page, please use the **Lowest** rating. You do not need to develop expertise to recognize all types of spam techniques described in the Google Search Web Spam Policies. However, with practice, we do expect you to recognize the techniques described in this section.

##### 4.6.1 Cannot Determine a Purpose, No MC, Little MC, Lowest Quality MC or No Added Value MC

## All pages should be created with sufficient MC quality so that the page can achieve its purpose. However, some pages are so lacking in MC that the purpose of the page itself is unclear or you may suspect the page is not actually created for people. If any of the following are true, the page should be rated **Lowest** : ● Despite your best efforts, the purpose of the page cannot truly be understood because the MC is gibberish or otherwise unusable for people ● The page deliberately has no MC ● The page is deliberately created with so little MC that it fails to achieve any purpose ● The page is deliberately created with such low quality MC that it fails to achieve any purpose ● The MC is created with little to no effort, has no originality and the MC adds no value compared to similar pages on the web

##### 4.6.2 Hacked, Defaced, or Spammed Pages

## A hacked or defaced website is a site that has been modified without permission from the website owner(s). Websites can become hacked, defaced, or filled with a large amount of distracting and unhelpful content from bad actors. Bad actors may add unrelated MC or SC or may modify existing MC on webpages to change the purpose of the page. These pages should be rated **Lowest** because they fail to achieve their original purpose. Responsible website owners should regularly check their websites for suspicious behavior and take steps to protect users. A common problem on forum pages or in the comments sections of pages is "spammed" comments: posts with unrelated comments that are not intended to help other people, but rather to advertise a product or create a link to a website. Frequently these comments are posted by a “bot” rather than a real person. If a specific page on a website has many unrelated “spammed” comments, the page should be rated **Lowest**. See the Google Search Essentials Hacked Content Policy for more information.

##### 4.6.3 Expired Domain Abuse

## Expired domain abuse is where an expired domain name is purchased and repurposed primarily to benefit the new website owner by hosting content that provides little to no value to users. Often the expired domain was a highly trusted site such as a government website, a charity, or a school with a trustworthy looking URL. The new website owner hopes to rank well using the reputation of the expired domain. The new content is often highly monetized or otherwise benefits the owner of the website. Visitors to the website may be confused by the new content, expecting to find a trustworthy government website, charity, etc. Here are some examples: ● Affiliate content on a site previously used by a government agency ● Commercial medical products being sold on a site previously used by a non-profit medical charity ● Casino-related content on a former elementary school site How can you tell if a page is abusing an expired domain? Sometimes the URL or other aspects of the website offers a clue. For example, the URL may look like an elementary school website but the current content is on a topic that you would not expect from an elementary school such as payday loans or gambling. To confirm, look up the homepage or other pages of the website on the Internet Archive to see if an obvious change has occurred.

##### 4.6.4 Site Reputation Abuse

## Site reputation abuse is a tactic where third-party content is published on a host site mainly because of that host's already-established ranking signals, which it has earned primarily from its first-party content. The goal of this tactic is for the content to rank better than it could otherwise on its own. Third-party content is content that's created by an entity that's separate from the established host site. Examples of separate entities include users of that site, freelancers, white-label services, and content created by people not employed directly by the host site. Having third-party content alone isn't site reputation abuse; it's only site reputation abuse if the third-party content is published on a host site mainly because of that host site's already-established ranking signals. Examples of site reputation abuse include, but are not limited to: ● An educational site hosting a page about sponsored reviews of payday loans written by a third-party that distributes the same page to other sites across the web ● A medical site hosting a third-party advertising page about "best casinos" that readers wouldn’t expect and that’s being placed on the site to rank better due to the established site’s ranking signals ● A movie review site hosting third-party pages about topics that would be confusing to users to find on a movie review site (such as "ways to buy followers on social media sites", the "best fortune teller sites", and the "best essay writing services") ● A news site hosting coupons provided by a white-label service where the main reason for publishing the coupons on the news site is to capitalize on the news site's reputation ● An established first party site branches out into a new area primarily using freelance content because this content will rank better on the first-party site than it would have otherwise Examples that are **NOT** considered site reputation abuse include: ● Wire service or press release service sites ● News publications that have syndicated news content from other news publications ● Sites designed to allow user-generated content, such as a forum website or comment sections ● Columns, opinion pieces, articles, and other work of an editorial nature ● Third-party content (for example, "advertorial" or "native advertising" type pages) where the purpose is to share content directly to readers (such as through promotion within the publication itself), rather than hosting the content to manipulate search rankings ● Using affiliate links throughout a page, with links treated appropriately , or embedding third-party ad units throughout a page ● Coupons that are sourced directly from merchants and other businesses that serve consumers

##### 4.6.5 Scaled Content Abuse

## Creating an abundance of content with little effort or originality with no editing or manual curation is often the defining attribute of spammy websites. Scaled content abuse is a spam practice described in the Google Search Web Spam Policies. Scaled content abuse occurs when many pages are generated for the purpose of primarily benefiting the website owner and not helping users. This practice is typically focused on creating large amounts of unoriginal content that provides little to no value for website visitors compared to other similar pages on the web, no matter how it's created. Examples of scaled content abuse include: ● Using automated tools (generative AI or otherwise) as a low-effort way to produce many pages that add little-to-no value for website visitors as compared to other pages on the web on the same topic. ● Scraping feeds, search results, or other content to generate many pages (including through automated transformations like synonymizing, translating, or other obfuscation techniques), where little value is provided to

##### Visitors

## ● Stitching or combining content from different web pages without adding value ● Creating multiple sites with the intent of hiding the scaled nature of the content ● Creating many pages where the content makes little or no sense to a reader but contains search keywords Pages and websites made up of content created at scale with no original content or added value for users, should be rated **Lowest** , no matter how they are created. Even if you are unsure of the method of creation, e.g. whether or not the page is created using generative AI tools, you should still use the **Lowest** rating when you strongly suspect scaled content abuse after looking at several pages on the website. **4.6.6 MC Created with Little to No Effort, Little to No Originality, and Little to No Added Value for Website Visitors** The **Lowest** rating applies if all or almost all of the MC on the page (including text, images, audio, videos, etc) is copied, paraphrased, embedded, auto or AI generated, or reposted from other sources with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for visitors to the website. Such pages should be rated **Lowest** , even if the page assigns credit for the content to another source. As a reminder, there are many types of effort that people put into content creation, from directly creating the content on the page to building custom page functionality. The criteria "little to no effort" means little to no effort of any type. Please review the description of Effort in Section 3.2 Quality of the Main Content. The word “copied” refers to the practice of “scraping” content, or copying content from other non-affiliated websites without adding any original content or value to users (see here for more information on copied or scraped content). Any type of content may be copied: text, images, video, etc. Images may be slightly cropped or edited to avoid detection. People may alter videos as well, or even make a video of a screen playing video\! **Important** : Licensed or syndicated content should not be considered as “copied” (see here for more on web syndication). Examples of syndicated content in the U.S. include news articles by AP or Reuters.

## Content on a webpage may be "paraphrased" from another source. We will consider MC to be paraphrased if it contains content that is unoriginal and exists on other pages, with different wording, organization or phrasing. People can paraphrase content manually by rewriting the content from other sources using different words. Automated tools can also be used to create paraphrased content by restating or summarizing the content on other pages. Sometimes content is "embedded" or included on the page from another source. There is nothing wrong with embedding content, but the **Lowest** rating applies if there is no significant original content or added value on the page. Social media posts may be reposted by an unrelated account. There is nothing wrong with reposting content, but the **Lowest** rating applies if there is no added value in the form of additional content, context, or discussion. All of the following are considered copied or paraphrased content: ● **Content copied, reposted, or embedded exactly from an identifiable source.** Sometimes an entire page is copied, and sometimes just parts of the page are copied. Sometimes multiple pages are copied and then pasted together into a single page. Content that has been copied, reposted, or embedded exactly is usually the easiest type of copied content to identify. ● **Content that is copied, but changed slightly from the original.** This type of copying makes it difficult to find the exact matching original source. Sometimes just a few words are changed, or whole sentences are changed, or a “find and replace” modification is made, where one word is replaced with another throughout the text. Images may be cropped or videos may be segmented into shorter clips. These types of changes are deliberately done to make it difficult to find the original source of the content. We call this kind of content “copied with minimal alteration.” ● **Content copied from a changing source, such as a search results page or news feed.** You often won't be able to find an exact matching original source if it is a copy of “dynamic” content (content that changes frequently). However, we will still consider this to be copied content. **● Content that is paraphrased from a single source or multiple sources.** Content from a single page or from many websites can be summarized, reworded or paraphrased by people or generative AI tools. Paraphrasing may be valuable, for example when an expert paraphrases the contents of a government policy in easy-to-understand language. **Important** : Copying, paraphrasing, embedding or reposting content does not automatically make a page **Lowest** quality. However, the **Lowest** rating is required when all or almost all of the MC on the page (including text, images, audio, videos, etc) is copied, paraphrased, embedded, or reposted with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors. Likewise, the use of Generative AI tools alone does not determine the level of effort or Page Quality rating. Generative AI tools may be used for high quality and low quality content creation. For example, a high level of effort may be involved in creating high quality original artwork using Generative AI tools. However, it's also possible to use Generative AI tools to create **Lowest** quality content with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors.

##### 4.6.7 How to Determine if Content is Copied

## How do you determine whether all or most of the MC is copied? How do you identify the original source of the content? How do you know if content is paraphrased from a single page or from multiple pages? These things can be difficult to determine, but the following steps may help.

1. ## Copy a sentence or phrase in the text. It may be necessary to try a few sentences or phrases from the page just    to be sure. When deciding what sentence or phrase to copy, try to find a sentence or series of several words    without punctuation, unusual characters, or suspicious words that may have replaced the original text.

2. ## Search on Google by pasting the sentence or phrase (surrounded by quotation marks to search for an exact    match) inside the Google search box. You may also try without quotation marks to search for more general    matches.

## Here are some sentences and phrases from this page about “The Wizard of Oz” film and how to search for

## them.

## Sentence or Phrase From a Sentence Query to Find the Sentence or Phrase

## A sentence on the page:

## All are convinced by Dorothy that the Wizard can help them

## too

## Try the query both with and without quotation marks around

## the sentence:

## \[ “ All are convinced by Dorothy that the Wizard can help

## them too ” \]

## \[ All are convinced by Dorothy that the Wizard can help

## them too \]

## A phrase on the page:

## Dorothy uses the Golden Cap to summon the Winged

## Monkeys

## Try the query both with and without quotation marks around

## the sentence:

## \[ “ Dorothy uses the Golden Cap to summon the Winged

## Monkeys ” \]

## \[ Dorothy uses the Golden Cap to summon the Winged

## Monkeys \]

## A different phrase on the page:

## revealing an old man who had journeyed to Oz from Omaha

## long ago in a hot air balloon

## Try the query both with and without quotation marks around

## the sentence:

## \[ “ revealing an old man who had journeyed to Oz from

## Omaha long ago in a hot air balloon ” \]

## \[ revealing an old man who had journeyed to Oz from

## Omaha long ago in a hot air balloon \]

## 

3. ## Compare the pages you find that match the sentence or phrase. Is most of their MC the same? If so, does one    clearly come from a highly authoritative source that is known for original content creation (newspaper, magazine,    medical foundation, etc.)? Does one source seem to reasonably be the original? Does one source appear to    have the earliest publication date, verified by sources like the Wayback Machine?    Based on this older version of a Wikipedia article about “The Wizard of Oz,” which can be found using the Internet Archive    Wayback Machine , we can confirm that the text in the table has been copied. Please note that searching for the above    sentence and phrases will not lead you to a current Wikipedia article about “The Wizard of Oz,” which demonstrates how    confirming that the MC of a page contains copied content can sometimes be difficult.    Paraphrased content can be much harder to recognize. Use the same process described above to search for other pages    with similar content by searching for sentences from the page or searching for the page title. Paraphrased content is    likely to:    ● Only contain commonly known information or generally known facts    ● Have high overlap with webpages on well established sources such as Wikipedia, reference websites, etc.    ● Appear to summarize a specific page such as a forum discussion or news article without any added value    ● Have words or other indications of summarizing or paraphrasing generative AI tools, such as words like "As an AI    language model" ( example )

## Use your best judgment. Sometimes it is clear that the content is copied or paraphrased from somewhere, but you cannot tell what the original source is. Other times the content found on the original source has changed enough that searches for sentences or phrases may no longer match the original source. For example, Wikipedia articles can change dramatically over time. Text copied from old copies may not match the current content. Summaries or paraphrased content may have a different organizational structure than the original source. If you strongly suspect the page you are evaluating is not the original source, consider it likely to be copied or paraphrased. **Important** : If all or almost all of the MC on the page (including text, images or videos) is copied, paraphrased, embedded, or reposted from other sources, you must assess the level of effort, originality and added value for website visitors in order to assign a rating. The **Lowest** rating is appropriate if there is little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors. The **Low** rating is appropriate if there is low effort, originality or added value to website visitors.

#### 4.7 Examples of Lowest Quality Pages

## Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation

## Lowest: Untrustworthy

## Untrustworthy

## ● Multiple, obvious and odd factual

## inaccuracies

## ● Lowest E-E-A-T

## This page appears to be an informational

## article about the animal the praying mantis.

## Factual inaccuracies and odd statements exist

## in the section titled “ Praying Mantises Are Not

## Poisonous ”: "In contrast to praying mollies,

## which are mostly solitary creatures that avoid

## human interaction, praying mollusks are more

## closely related to God. There are no poisonous

## snakes, and there are no venomous turtles."

## Odd, factually inaccurate and/or misleading

## statements:

## ● The section suddenly refers to

## praying mantises as “praying mollies”

## 

* ## a name does that isn’t supported   through a quick web search   ● Praying mollusks do not exist \- there   is no such animal   ● Statements about animals and their   relation to God are not what one   would expect on an informational   page like this   ● Poisonous snakes exist   It is unlikely a human author would make these   odd statements and obvious mistakes. It's   likely this content was auto-generated with no   human editing.   No matter how this content was created, the   odd statements and factual inaccuracies make   this article untrustworthy and therefore Lowest   E-E-A-T and Lowest quality.

## **Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation** Lowest: Lowest E-E-A-T and Deceptive **Untrustworthy** ● This page has a deceptive purpose: the page claims to be an informational resource for parents, but the website terms of service state that it is published for AI enthusiasts and is not intended for the general public. ● The website terms of use states that "some articles" are generated by artificial intelligence and may have errors or be out of date; there is no indication to which pages this statement applies. The information in this article is not trustworthy and is Lowest E-E-A-T The page appears to be an informational article about switching babies from breast milk to whole milk. The bottom of the page states "Our blog is dedicated to all things related to kids and parenting – including product reviews, news, recipes, and more. We strive to provide parents with the information they need in order to make informed decisions for their families." However, if you read the terms of service page, you'll find a very different description of pages on the website. The terms of use page states "Some articles on this website might have been partially generated by an artificial intelligence language model and published for experimental and research purposes. The articles on this website are only to be used as proof of concept by AI enthusiasts and not intended for general public. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for the use or interpretation of this content for any other purpose than it was intended. While we strive for accuracy and quality, please note that the information provided may not be entirely error-free or up-to-date**.** We recommend independently verifying the content and consulting with professionals for specific advice or information." Given the statements above, the articles on this website should be considered untrustworthy and Lowest E-E-A-T. Lowest: Superiority of Specified Group 1 This is the homepage of Stormfront, a white supremacist website. The site is known for propagating white nationalism, antisemitism, Holocaust denial, white supremacy, and Islamophobia. **Harmful to Specified Groups** ● Promotes, condones, or incites hatred against a Specified Group of people ● Lowest website reputation Inciting hatred towards Specified Groups significantly harms members of those groups and society as whole. This page is on a YMYL topic. This website has an extremely negative reputation for promoting white supremacy, antisemitism, Holocaust denial, etc.

## **Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation** Lowest: Superiority of Specified Group 2 This page describes a non-scientifically backed theory of superiority of a Specified Group. **Harmful to Specified Groups, Harmfully** **Misleading Information** ● Promotes, condones, or incites hatred against a Specified Group of people ● Contains unsubstantiated theories/claims not grounded in any reasonable facts or evidence Unsubstantiated claims about a Specified Group significantly harms members of that group and society as a whole. This page is on a YMYL topic. The purpose of the page is to promote the view of superiority of a group of people. This page makes unsubstantiated claims about the role of melanin in the human body. Lowest: Non-medical drug use advice This post encourages mixing an anti-anxiety drug with a recreational drug. **Harmful to Self or Other Individuals** ● Encourages, depicts, incites, or directly causes physical, mental, emotional, or financial harm to self or others Potentially harmful use of drugs could significantly impact a person’s health. This is a YMYL topic. This post and other content on the page encourages dangerous behavior that could cause harm. Lowest: Eating disorder encouragement This page has posts that encourage people to lose weight in unhealthy ways. **Harmful to Self or Other Individuals,** **Harmfully Misleading Information** ● Encourages, depicts, incites, or directly causes physical, mental, emotional, or financial harm to self or others ● Contains information that contradicts well-established expert consensus Eating disorders and decisions to seek medical treatment significantly impact a person’s health. This is a YMYL topic. This post encourages harmful behavior. "Proana" or pro-anorexia is a movement to view anorexia as a lifestyle choice, not a disease. Proana and similar "thinspiration" pages contradict well-established expert consensus that anorexia is a life-threatening eating disorder. Lowest: Personal information collection scam Superficially, this looks like a payment page on a merchant site. However, the form asks for highly sensitive personal information such as social security number, drivers license number, bank account numbers, and ATM PIN. **Harmful to Self or Other Individuals,** **Untrustworthy** ● Encourages, depicts, incites, or directly causes physical, mental, emotional, or financial harm to self or others ● Characteristics of scams, malicious downloads, or other harmful behavior Sharing highly sensitive personal information could significantly impact a person’s financial security. This page is on a YMYL topic. While this looks like a merchant site, the true purpose of this page is to collect information that could be used to commit identity theft or remove money from someone's bank account.

## **Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation** Lowest: Poor financial advice and possible scam This is an article suggesting clicking on a link to avoid paying debt. **Untrustworthy** ● Inadequate information about the website or content creator for the purpose of the page ● Lowest E-E-A-T ● Deceptive page design ● Characteristics of scams, malicious downloads, or other harmful behavior Debt management significantly impacts a person’s financial security. This is a YMYL topic. This page has multiple **Lowest** quality characteristics. From the MC, it is evident that the content creator lacks financial expertise (inconsistent with well-established expert consensus on what to do for debt relief). Furthermore, the page appears to be designed to manipulate people into clicking one of several prominent links rather than helping people by providing sound financial advice. The promise of debt relief is a common form of manipulation and scam technique. Lowest: Miley Cyrus is dead "news article" on a deceptive website This is a factually inaccurate article on a website called "Now 8 News". It falsely claims Miley Cyrus is dead. **Harmfully Misleading Information,** **Untrustworthy** ● Contains clearly inaccurate information that can be refuted by straightforward and widely accepted facts ● Deceptive page design This website is designed to look like a news site and yet has deliberate factually inaccurate information. There is no information on who is responsible for this content. There is no date for the news article or date of death, which would be a key part of any standard reporting. This page was designed to misinform or deceive. Lowest: Crystals heal cancer potential scam This article explains how crystals can be used to help cure cancers. It has a prominent "Shop Crystals" link at the top. **Harmfully Misleading Information,** **Untrustworthy** ● Contains unsubstantiated theories/claims not grounded in any reasonable facts or evidence ● Contains information that contradicts well-established expert consensus ● Characteristics of scams, malicious downloads, or other harmful behavior Claims about cancer cures could significantly impact people’s decisions to seek medical treatment. This page is on a YMYL topic. The claims made about the healing power of crystals contradict well-established expert scientific and medical consensus. Selling "cures" for diseases such as cancer is a commonly used scam technique.

## **Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation** Lowest: Flat earth This is a homepage of The Flat Earth Society, a group of people dedicated to spreading the belief that the earth is flat. **Harmfully Misleading Information** ● Contains unsubstantiated theories/claims not grounded in any reasonable facts or evidence ● Contains clearly inaccurate information that can be refuted by straightforward and widely accepted facts ● Contains information that contradicts well-established expert consensus Claims contradicting well-established scientific consensus about the shape of the earth undermine trust in scientific institutions such as NOAA, the agency responsible for issuing alerts during dangerous weather events. This is a YMYL topic. The purpose of this website is promoting misleading information. It is harmful to people and society as it undermines trust in public institutions. Lowest: Dry socket medical info This YMYL medical site has literally no information about who is responsible for the content or the website. **Untrustworthy** ● Inadequate information about the website or content creator for the purpose of the page Medical information about this dental condition could significantly impact how people seek dental treatment. This page is on a YMYL topic. There is no information about who created this website, no contact information, and no information about the author. Medical pages require a high level of user trust. Because there is no information about who owns this website and who created this content, this is considered an untrustworthy website. Lowest: Merchant with little contact info, untrustworthy characteristics This looks like a product listing page on a merchant website. **Untrustworthy** ● Inadequate information about the website or content creator for the purpose of the page ● Characteristics of scams, malicious downloads, or other harmful behavior Inaccurate information about shipping and returns, deceptive use of logos and no information about who is responsible make this shopping site appear potentially fraudulent and untrustworthy. This page is selling Nike Air Jordan shoes. However, there is inadequate contact information on the contact us page for a merchant site. In addition, the Shipping and Returns page has the name of another company that seems to be unrelated. There are also official looking logos at the bottom of the homepage, including the Better Business Bureau logo and Google Checkout logo, that don’t appear to be affiliated with the website.

## **Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation** Lowest: Stomach flu lowest EAT article This poorly written article describes how to cure the stomach flu. **Harmfully Misleading Information,** **Untrustworthy** ● Contains information that contradicts well-established expert consensus ● Inadequate information about the website or content creator for the purpose of the page ● Lowest E-E-A-T Many patient hospitalizations and deaths occur due to the flu each year. This topic could significantly impact a person’s health. This is a YMYL topic. The writing is poor and the information is not consistent with standard medical guidance. It is clear from the content the author does not have medical expertise. This page should not be trusted as a medical resource. Lowest: Pimple popping lowest EAT article This very poorly written article describes popping pimples. **Untrustworthy** ● Inadequate information about the website or content creator for the purpose of the page ● Lowest E-E-A-T The writing is extremely poor and there is virtually no information in this article. For example, the opening sentence is "Popping pimples could be or could be not the new trend of getting rid of them." It is clear from the content that the author does not have skin care expertise. Lowest: Malicious merchant site This website appears to be an eyeglasses merchant site. **Harmful to Self or Other Individuals,** **Untrustworthy** ● Encourages, depicts, incites, or directly causes physical, mental, emotional, or financial harm to self or others ● Lowest E-E-A-T ● Characteristics of scams, malicious downloads, or other harmful behavior This website swindled people and physically threatened people who complained. These articles on Wikipedia and the New York Times describe the deceptive techniques used by this website and provide other negative information about the website and its owner. The reputation of this website is lowest based on reports of malicious behavior. Lowest: Chicken recipes no MC This looks like a list of chicken recipes, but is actually a list of links that are ads. **Untrustworthy, Spammy** ● No MC ● Deceptive page design ● Content created with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors MC should be created to benefit people who come to the website. Pages without MC should be considered spammy as they crowd out and disincentivize the creation of pages with high quality MC. Pages with Ads that are designed to look like MC should be considered untrustworthy.

## **Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation** Lowest: Mesothelioma deceptive directory This page looks like a listing of resources about Mesothelioma, a form of lung cancer. **Untrustworthy, Spammy** ● No MC ● Deceptive page design ● Content created with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors Information about cancer could significantly impact how people make decisions related to medical treatment. This page is on a YMYL topic. This page is designed to look like a directory page or a list of helpful resources, but every link is an Ad. There is no MC on this page. Pages without MC should be considered spammy as they crowd out and disincentivize the creation of pages with high quality MC. Pages that disguise Ads as directory listings or other MC should be considered untrustworthy. Lowest: Ads deliberately obscure MC When you first visit the page, it appears that there is no MC, only Ads. If you scroll down, you will eventually find the MC at the bottom. **Untrustworthy** ● Deliberately obstructed or obscured MC This page requires scrolling past so many Ads to get to the MC that many people may stop scrolling and leave the page before reaching the MC. Deliberately obscured MC to benefit the website with no help for people visiting the page should be considered untrustworthy. Lowest: Deceptive and untrustworthy fake survey page This page appears to be a survey with the opportunity to win an Apple MacBook Air, an iPhone 5c, or a Galaxy S4. **Untrustworthy, Spammy** ● Inadequate information about the website or content creator for the purpose of the page ● Deceptive page design ● Characteristics of scams, malicious downloads, or other harmful behavior ● Content created with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors This page contains a fake survey, which appears to promise users the opportunity to win an Apple MacBook Air, an iPhone 5c, or a Galaxy S4. However, there is no information about who is responsible for the survey, even though upon clicking, the survey asks for highly personal information such as bank account numbers. The message at the top of the page, “Thank You from Goggle.com” and survey content could mislead users to think that the survey is affiliated with Google. This page is deceptive and should be considered untrustworthy.

## **Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation** Lowest: Lowest MC free credit report The title of the page suggests that it may provide a credit report from the government "freecreditreport gov". However, the page has gibberish MC and spammy looking features, such as ads or links surrounding the meaningless text. **Untrustworthy, Spammy** ● Extremely misleading title ● Inadequate information about the website or content creator for the purpose of the page ● Deceptive page design ● Characteristics of scams, malicious downloads, or other harmful behavior ● Cannot determine any purpose, e.g., gibberish MC ● Content created with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors Credit reports could significantly impact one’s financial security. This is a YMYL topic. The MC is gibberish. There is no beneficial purpose of gibberish MC. The title of the page is misleading, given the MC. This page also has deceptive features in the supplementary content, such as a friend request, a prize alert, and a download button. It is highly likely that these are ads or malicious download links. Lowest: Buy Xanax This is a page on the website for the U.S. Green Building Council. However, this page has the words "Buy Xanax" over and over again, along with related words about buying Xanax and a URL link. **Untrustworthy, Spammy** ● Characteristics of scams, malicious downloads, or other harmful behavior ● Content created with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors Prescription drugs could significantly impact a person’s health. This is a YMYL topic. This specific page has been created or modified on this organization's website in hopes that people will click on the link to buy the prescription drug Xanax. This is a spam technique. Spammers hope that the page will rank well in search results because the website is otherwise high quality. The words "buy xanax" are used repeatedly in hopes that the page will show up for the search "buy xanax". Attempting to spam search engines and trick people into clicking on links is highly untrustworthy behavior.

## **Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation** Lowest: Auto-generated car engine code This page is full of supplementary content, links, and large ads. The MC at the top gives information about a specific error code P2570 and a second block of main content in the middle shows more information about P2570. The MC is broken up by large ads and it is difficult to understand due to the poor content quality. **Untrustworthy, Spammy** ● Inadequate information about the website or content creator for the purpose of the page ● Content created with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors This page has low quality MC and spammy attributes. The page repeats the error code "P2570" beyond what is helpful for users- a technique known as irrelevant keywords. The small amount of MC is not original to the website. Lists of error codes are available either by purchase or by scraping. An important fact is missing at the top "When you check engine light came on code P2570 the reason should be ." The reason is left out \- this should be the most important content on the page\! Looking at other pages on the website, it is clear that each page is created automatically by filling in a template from a list of error code information. There appears to be little to no manual editing or checking to make sure the error code content is correctly pulled in, as evident by the missing reason on this page. As with many spammy websites, there is no information about who is responsible for this website and no way to report problems with the page.

## **Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation** Lowest: Auto-generated bulldog wrinkle wipes This page claims to list the best bulldog wrinkle wipes and uses affiliate links. **Untrustworthy, Spammy** ● Inadequate information about the website or content creator for the purpose of the page ● Deceptive page design ● Content created with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors The MC on this page is copied with little or no time, effort, expertise, manual curation, or added value for users. Looking at the content at the bottom of the page and exploring other pages on the website, it is clear that each page is created automatically using content from Amazon and substituting different product names into a generic template. There appears to be little to no manual editing or curation on this page. The true purpose of this page is to bring users seeking information about products to this website in hopes that they will click and order products by clicking on Amazon affiliate links. This website does not have a beneficial purpose for users but rather was created to benefit the creator of the website. Though the website discloses that they use affiliate links, the site offers no added value for users. As with many deceptive websites, there is no information about who is responsible for this website. Lowest: Viagra copied content This looks like an information website for the drug Viagra. **Untrustworthy, Spammy** ● Inadequate information about the website or content creator for the purpose of the page ● Deceptive page design ● Content created with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors Information about prescription drugs could significantly impact a person’s health. This page is on a YMYL topic. All MC on this page is copied with little or no time, effort, expertise, manual curation, or added value for users. Here is the original source. Exploration of the pages on this website are similarly created with little expertise or added value for users. The true purpose of this page is to bring users seeking information about Viagra to this website in hopes that they will click on the “order now” link. The "order now" link goes to another website and is likely monetized. Therefore, this website does not have a beneficial purpose for users but rather was created to benefit another website. As with many deceptive websites, there is no information about who is responsible for this website.

## **Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation** Lowest: Scaled content abuse cancers **Spammy** ● Scaled content abuse ● All of the MC on the page (including text, images or videos) is paraphrased with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors This page is a YMYL medical article. The contents of the page show it is created with generative AI with likely no original content and provides no value to users. For example, the article starts with "As a language model, I don’t have real-time data and my knowledge cutoff date is September 2021\. Cancer rankings.." The end of the text of the article appears to be cut off with an incomplete sentence "Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs): Pancreatic NETs are a rare type of pancreatic cancer that can have a poor" This is spam (scaled content abuse) and a highly untrustworthy medical page: it demonstrates no real expertise and may not be correct and is especially concerning for YMYL topics. Lowest: Scaled content abuse tumors **Untrustworthy, Spammy** ● Scaled content abuse ● Deceptive information about the website purpose ● All of the MC on the page (including text, images or videos) is paraphrased or embedded with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors Website information indicates this is a website for rabbit enthusiasts "We are rabbit lovers and breeders, we will share some of our guides here, welcome to discuss with us." However the website includes articles on a very wide variety of topics unrelated to rabbits such as YMYL human health, making the information about the website appear deceptive. All the MC on the page is embedded from a different source or likely paraphrased and unoriginal. If you explore the site, you'll find hundreds of templated articles with unoriginal, paraphrased content and embedded videos. This is an example of scaled content abuse. While the method of content creation is unknown, the format of the articles (question and answer) is a common technique to create scaled content by collecting questions (available from sources such as Google Search's "People also ask" feature ) and answering the questions with unoriginal, paraphrased content (often using generative AI tools).

## **Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation** Lowest: Expired domain abuse **Untrustworthy, Spammy** ● Expired domain abuse ● Highly misleading URL At the time of this example, the URL for this example was ruralschools.org. Previously ruralschools.org was owned by an organization called Organizations Concerned for Rural Education (OCRE). Using the Internet Archive , we can see what the page used to look like. Currently the content is about the Hong Kong lottery. People may be genuinely expecting a website about rural schools for this URL. Consider URLs to be misleading or deceptive when the URL looks like a high quality government agency, school, charity or otherwise trusted source but the content is low quality and completely unrelated, e.g. low quality content about medical products, loans, lottery tickets, gambling, etc.

## **Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation** Lowest: Site reputation abuse **Untrustworthy, Spammy** ● Site reputation abuse ● Deceptive page content; untrustworthy due to conflict of interest This is an article published on a news website. The top of the page has a Sponsored Content banner. The page goes on to disclose: "Articles attributed to this byline are authored by paying advertisers. The editorial team did not contribute to these pieces, and the opinions expressed do not necessarily represent those of the editorial staff. Refer to our partner statement to better understand the nature of the relationship. The sponsor retains responsibility for the content and holds the copyright to their material" This page qualifies as site reputation abuse because the content on the page is produced by a third party (a supplement maker) and published on this news website to inherit the reputation of the news publisher, even though the new publisher is not responsible for this content. In addition to site reputation abuse, there are also potentially misleading and untrustworthy aspects to this article that warrant a Lowest rating: ● Even though there is a disclaimer, the content could be mistaken for an article written by the newspaper. ● The article appears to be an independent review for a supplement, but is actually written by the producer of the supplement. ● There is a clear conflict of interest, making this an untrustworthy source of information

## **Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation** Lowest: Scaled content abuse chickens **Untrustworthy, Spammy** ● Scaled content abuse ● Deceptive information about the website purpose ● Most or all of the MC on the page (including text, images or videos) is paraphrased or embedded with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors ● Repetitive, low value to no add MC The about us page describes the website as providing information for seniors: "we provide non-medical information to senior citizens in their own homes or apartments." However, the site hosts hundreds of articles on all sorts of topics. The articles are templated, have paraphrased text content and embedded videos from other sources. This is an example of Scaled Content Abuse. This page is titled with a poorly phrased question "How Cold Can Chickens Tolerate" The answer text is poorly written and starts off bizarrely: "What is this? Cold weather chickens..." The page goes on to have repetitive questions and poorly produced responses. "What temp is too cold for chickens?" "Is 40 degrees too cold for chickens?", etc. A careful read of the answers shows that the sentences may make sense individually, but not as a whole. For example "How cold can chickens tolerate at night? Chickens can survive quite well with temperatures down into the teens. In fact, if you place a thermometer in your coop overnight, you will likely find the temperature has been maintained in the thirty to forty-degree area." (The second sentence does not make sense following the first.) While the method of content creation is unknown, the format of the articles (question and answer) is commonly used to create low effort, unoriginal, paraphrased content with generative AI tools. The text does not appear to have been written or edited by a human editor.

### 5.0 Low Quality Pages

## **Low** quality pages do not achieve their purpose well because they are lacking in an important dimension or have a problematic aspect. **Low** quality pages do not meet the standards for **Lowest** but may have similar though milder undesirable characteristics. To identify **Low** quality pages, start by considering the following: Initial Consideration **Low** Quality Pages The purpose of the page **Low** quality pages have a beneficial or non-harmful purpose. The potential for the page to cause harm as described in these guidelines **Low** quality pages have either no potential to cause harm, or have some mild potential for harm but do not meet the standards for **Lowest** as described in Section 4.0. The topic of the page, the type of website, and the extent to which YMYL standards apply A page on any topic or any type of website may qualify for **Low.** Give special scrutiny to pages or websites needing a high level of trust, such as online stores, medical websites, or news coverage of major civic issues. Next, assess the page to determine if any of the criteria for **Low** apply: **Low** Page Quality Assessment Any one of the following is justification for **Low** Quality of the MC MC is created without adequate effort, originality, talent, or skill necessary to achieve the purpose of the page in a satisfying way. The title of the page The page title is slightly misleading, shocking, or exaggerated. The role of Ads and SC on the page The Ads or SC significantly distract from or interrupt the use of the MC as described in Section 5.3. Information provided by the website and content creator Unsatisfying amount of website information or information about the content creator for the purpose of the page. **Important** : For personal content shared on social media platforms or forums, an alias or username is adequate. Reputation of the website and content creator A mildly negative reputation of the website or content creator. Trustworthiness of the page: E-E-A-T Inadequate level of E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page. **Important** : Low quality pages can occur on any type of website, including academic websites, nonprofit websites, government websites, or any other generally helpful type of website. Low quality pages may be about any topic. Pages on YMYL topics need more scrutiny for signs of Low quality related to the MC and website/content creator because the page could impact a person’s health, financial stability, or safety, or the welfare or well-being of society. However, for any type of page, a single Low quality attribute is enough to use the **Low** quality rating.

#### 5.1 Lacking E-E-A-T

## **Low** quality pages often lack an appropriate level of E-E-A-T for the topic or purpose of the page. Here are some examples: ● The content creator lacks adequate experience, e.g. a restaurant review written by someone who has never eaten at the restaurant ● The content creator lacks adequate expertise, e.g. an article about how to skydive written by someone with no expertise in the subject ● The website or content creator is not an authoritative or trustworthy source for the topic of the page, e.g. tax form downloads provided on a cooking website. ● The page or website is not trustworthy for its purpose, e.g. a shopping page with minimal customer service information **Important:** The **Low** rating should be used if the page lacks appropriate E-E-A-T for its purpose. No other considerations such as positive reputation or the type of website can overcome a lack of E-E-A-T for the topic or purpose of the page.

#### 5.2 Low Quality Main Content

## MC is **Low** quality if it is created without adequate effort, originality, talent, or skill necessary to achieve the purpose of the page in a satisfying way. Mild inaccuracies on informational pages are evidence of **Low** quality. However, if the page has harmful inaccuracies or so many inaccuracies that it feels untrustworthy, the **Lowest** rating is justified. Here are some examples of pages with **Low** quality MC: **Low Quality MC Examples Why the MC is considered Low quality** A crafting tutorial page with instructions on how to make a basic craft and lots of unhelpful "filler" at the top, such as commonly known facts about the supplies needed or other non-crafting information. Lacks adequate effort to clearly present the instructions to people hoping to make the craft. A list of the best vacuum cleaners with product images and reviews that are paraphrased or summarized from other sources, with minimal signs of effort or original content added by the content creator. Lacks adequate effort and first-hand experience from the content creator. A slide show of the top 10 world destinations using other people's pictures and existing top 10 lists. Lacks effort and originality. A page titled "How many centimeters are in a meter?" with a large amount of off-topic and unhelpful content such that the very small amount of helpful information is hard to find. Lacks effort, has excessive filler, lacks depth, and has only commonly known facts. A list of the tallest mountains in the world that is missing Mount Everest. Lacks accuracy and effort. The title of the page is also considered part of the MC. Titles are important because they represent the page in search results and help users decide what to click on. A misleading title can lead to a poor search experience. Exaggerated or shocking titles are evidence of **Low** quality because of the poor user experience that results when users see the actual MC after reaching the page.

## Here are some examples of pages with **Low** quality titles: **Low Quality Title Examples Why the Title is considered Low quality** A page titled "Pink Elephant: Part 2 coming soon\!", but includes only speculation and rumor about a potential movie sequel that may or may not be produced. Slightly misleading title would give people the impression that the movie sequel has a confirmed release date, and that the page would provide accurate information about it. A page titled "Is the World about to End? Mysterious Sightings of Sea Serpents Prompt Panic\!", for an article about the remains of a dead fish on a beach. Exaggerated and shocking title is a mismatch with the content of the article. A page titled "Eat the Healthiest Foods in the WORLD to extend your life\!\!\!\!" for a list of tips on how to add more fruits and vegetables to meals. Overly exaggerated title suggests that the page would offer something more than the basic nutrition advice it provides. The level of talent or skill required for artistic expression by ordinary people on social media or other websites that allow content sharing should be viewed leniently. In many cases, people post activities to share with friends, such as a video documenting a first attempt at a new hobby. These types of pages should not be considered **Low** on the basis of talent or skill because the primary purpose is sharing content. Use the **Low** rating only if the lack of talent or skill prevents the page from achieving its purpose well. **Important** : **Low** quality MC does not meet the standard for **Lowest** and is not harmful, but it is unsatisfying for the purpose of the page or causes the page to fail to achieve its purpose well.

##### 5.2.1 MC is Created with Low Effort, Low Originality and Low Added Value for Website Visitors

## People who search benefit from a variety of websites offering high quality content and good experiences to website visitors. However, some webpages are created by "repackaging" content available on higher quality sites, with low effort, low originality and low added value for website visitors compared to higher quality sources. As a reminder, the **Lowest** rating applies if all or almost all of the MC on the page (including text, images or videos) is copied, paraphrased, embedded, or reposted from other sources with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors. However, the **Low** rating should be used if much of the MC on the page is copied, paraphrased, embedded or reposted, with a low amount of effort to create value by editing, manually curating, reformatting or injecting some original content. Examples of low effort, low originality and low added value include ● Social media reposts with little additional comment or discussion ● Pages with content from other sources (e.g. pages of embedded videos or pages with "repinned" images) with little additional comment, discussion, or curation by the content creator of the page ● "Best" lists based on existing reviews and lists with little original content The **Low** rating applies when the MC is created using any technique with low effort, low originality, and low added value for website visitors compared to other pages that contain similar content.

##### 5.2.2 Filler as a Poor User Experience

## The main content (MC) of a page should support its purpose. Web site owners and content creators should place the most helpful and essential MC near the top of the page so that visitors can immediately access it. A high quality page has the most helpful MC placed most prominently. Content that supports the page purpose without directly contributing to the primary goal can be included, but it should be shown lower on the page in a less prominent position. For example, on recipe pages, the recipe itself and important supporting content directly related to the recipe should be prominently displayed near the top of the webpage. Sometimes, MC includes "filler" \- low-effort content that adds little value and doesn't directly support the purpose of the page. Filler can artificially inflate content, creating a page that appears rich but lacks content website visitors find valuable. Filler can result in a poor experience for people who visit the page, especially if placed prominently ahead of helpful content for the purpose of the page. **Important** : Content that supports the page purpose without directly contributing to its primary goal can still be valuable if placed appropriately. Filler refers to low-effort content that occupies valuable and prominent space without providing value or without being helpful or satisfying for the primary purpose of the page. A Low rating is appropriate if the page ● Contains a large amount of low quality and unhelpful filler, causing a poor experience for people visiting the page ● Contains a large amount visually prominent filler that makes it difficult to find the helpful MC, causing frustration for people visiting the page

#### 5.3 Distracting Ads/SC

## We expect Ads and SC to be visible. However, some Ads, SC, or interstitial pages (i.e., pages displayed before or after the content you are expecting) make it difficult to use the MC. Pages with Ads, SC, or other features that significantly distract from or make it difficult for the user to efficiently access the information they want from the page should typically be given a **Low** rating even if some of the MC is helpful. A single pop-over Ad or interstitial page with a clear and easy-to-use close button is not terribly distracting, even though it may annoy some people. However, difficult-to-close Ads that follow page scrolls, or interstitial pages that require an app download, can be truly distracting and make the MC difficult to use. You can see examples of interstitial pages here. The content of the Ads, SC, or other features may be distracting as well: sexually suggestive images such as here , grotesque images such as here , and sexually suggestive Ads on otherwise non-sexual pages are very distracting. Finally, Ads and SC can be distracting if the titles or images of the Ads or SC are shocking or disturbing. Here is an example of a page with shocking and exaggerated titles, images, and text in the Ads and SC. **Important** : The **Low** rating should be used if the page has Ads, SC, or other features that significantly distract from or interrupt the use of the MC.

#### 5.4 Mildly Negative Reputation of the Website or Content Creator

## The **Low** rating should be used if the website or the content creator has a mildly negative reputation. If the MC was created by a content creator who is using the website to host it, research the reputation of the content creator. Expect to find reputation information on well-known journalists, authors, social media influencers, bloggers and vloggers, professionals such as lawyers and doctors, etc. Pay attention when there is evidence of mildly negative—though not malicious or financially fraudulent—reputation. However, a lack of reputation information for ordinary people and lesser-known content creators is expected and is not a sign of **Low** quality. Exercise care when researching the reputation of businesses. Try to find enough reviews to understand a range of

## customer opinions and experiences, and read the details of negative reviews and low ratings before inferring that the business overall has a negative reputation. A few negative customer service reviews are typical for businesses such as stores or restaurants.

#### 5.5 Unsatisfying Amount of Information about the Website or Content Creator

## Expect to find some form of website information for many or most websites. We expect clear information about who (e.g., what individual, company, business, foundation, etc.) created the MC, unless there is good reason for anonymity. A long-standing Internet alias or username can identify the content creator. For personal websites or forum discussions on non-YMYL topics, an email address or social media link alone may be sufficient. Many people are reasonably hesitant to share personally identifiable information online\! Stores and websites that process financial transactions require a high level of user trust. If a store or financial transaction website has just an email address and physical address, it may be difficult to get help if there are issues with the transaction. Likewise, many other types of websites on clear YMYL topics also require a high level of user trust. **Important** : Pages that offer payment functionality or process other types of financial transactions should receive a **Low** rating if there is an unsatisfying amount of customer service information or contact information. Pages on YMYL topics and other pages that require a high level of user trust should receive a **Low** rating if there is an unsatisfying amount of information about who is responsible for the website or who created the content. For forums, social media pages, and other websites where people commonly exchange opinions, a username is an acceptable identifier.

#### 5.6 Exaggerated or Mildly Misleading Information about the Website or Content Creator

## Recall that deceptive information about a website or content creator is a strong reason for the **Lowest** rating. However, sometimes the information about the website or content provider seems exaggerated or mildly misleading, such as claims of personal experience or expertise that seem overstated or included just to impress website visitors. E-E-A-T assessments should be based on the MC itself, the information you find during reputation research, verifiable credentials, etc, not just website or content creator claims of "I'm an expert\!". If you find the information about the website or the content creator to be exaggerated or mildly misleading, the **Low** rating should be used.

## **Type of Webpage/Content Low Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation** Low: Article 2 Using ginger for your health ● Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page: does not achieve the purpose well ● MC lacks accuracy or does not align with well-established expert consensus ● Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page This informational article has multiple Low quality characteristics leading to a Low or Lowest+ rating. There is garbled or meaningless content, a complete lack of effort in editing, and unrelated links in the middle of the page. Additionally, the article is on a health topic, and there are no signs that the content creator has relevant expertise or links to support the medical claims made in the article. Low: Article 3 How to adopt children from Iraq ● Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page: does not achieve the purpose well ● Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page Adopting a child significantly impacts the health and well-being of families. This is a YMYL topic. However, the steps listed here are merely commonly-known information that would be of little benefit to someone interested in adopting a child from Iraq. For example, step 1 says “Choose an adoption agency” and suggests looking in a phone book. This demonstrates a lack of effort in the creation of MC. There is almost no information specific to Iraq. There is no evidence of expertise on adoption from the description about the author. Note that some Ads have the same format as links to other articles on this website, potentially making it a bit harder for users to visually distinguish these Ads from the MC and SC. Low: Article 4 ● MC has low effort, low originality and little added value compared to the original source This page summarizes a discussion page. There is little original content. It requires low effort to summarize a discussion. This page offers little added value over the original source.

## **Type of Webpage/Content Low Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation** Low: Financial Page with advice on picking a quality stock for investment ● Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page Advice on stock investment could significantly impact a person’s financial decisions and security. This is a YMYL topic. The MC is superficial and includes mostly commonly known information for this topic, e.g. "look at key statistics" or "find companies with rising revenue". There is no evidence that the author has financial expertise. Because this article gives advice on a YMYL financial topic, lacking expertise is a reason for a Low rating. Low: Medical Page with information about how long the flu lasts ● Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page Many patient hospitalizations and deaths occur due to the flu each year. This topic could significantly impact a person’s health. This is a YMYL topic. There is no evidence that the author has medical expertise. Because this article gives advice on a YMYL medical topic, lacking expertise is a reason for a Low rating. Low: Recipe 1 Apple pie recipe ● Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page: does not achieve the purpose well This page and website have many characteristics of Low quality pages. The MC is low quality and lacks important information. For example, it gives no indication of how to make a crust and doesn’t list premade crust as an ingredient. It would be very difficult to actually make an apple pie using this recipe. This page is lacking the kind of helpful content we expect in recipe pages, such as user reviews or comments. Without such information, it’s hard to tell if the recipe is any good. The small pink text at the top is not helpful for users. Low: Recipe 2 Gluten-free New York cheesecake recipe ● Ads or SC significantly distract from or interrupt the use of MC This is an example of distracting and disruptive Ads/SC: there are large Ads in the main column pushing down the MC as well as highly distracting content on the right that are labeled “Top Posts & Pages.” It is unclear whether these are SC or Ads. Additionally, the images in the Ads/SC are shocking, racy, and completely unrelated to the MC, which creates a poor user experience.

## **Type of Webpage/Content Low Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation** Low: Recipe 3 ● A large quantity of prominent filler makes it difficult to find the helpful MC ● Ads, SC and Filler MC distract from the helpful MC The primary purpose of the page is to share a recipe for Butterbeer. While helpful MC such as the ingredients and information about Butterbear are at the top of the page, significant scrolling is required to find the actual Butterbeer recipe. The "jump to recipe" link itself is difficult to find. The page has a large amount of content unrelated to Butterbeer between the Butterbeer ingredients and the Butterbeer recipe. The page has photos and reviews of many other unrelated foods at universal studios. In addition, Ads and SC and interstitials appear throughout causing additional scrolling to finally find the recipe towards the bottom. All of the above lead to a poor user experience. Note: A higher rating could be appropriate if the page were better organized, the recipe was prominently placed and easy to find, and there was less Filler, SC and Ads distracting from the helpful MC.

### 6.0 Medium Quality Pages

## **Medium** pages have a beneficial purpose and achieve their purpose. There is nothing wrong with **Medium** quality pages. Expect to encounter many **Medium** quality pages in PQ rating tasks. To identify **Medium** quality pages, start by considering the following: Initial Consideration **Medium** Quality Pages The purpose of the page **Medium** quality pages have a beneficial or non-harmful purpose. The potential for the page to cause harm as described in these guidelines **Medium** quality pages are not expected to cause harm. The topic of the page, the type of website, and the extent to which YMYL standards apply A page on any topic or any type of website may qualify for **Medium.** Give special scrutiny to pages on YMYL topics or websites needing a high level of trust, such as online stores. The title of the page **Medium** quality pages have titles that summarize the page. The role of Ads and SC on the page The Ads and SC do not block or significantly interfere with the MC on **Medium** quality pages. **Remember** : Many websites need monetization to share content with users. The presence or absence of Ads alone is not a consideration for PQ rating. Information provided by the website and content creator **Medium** quality pages have adequate information about the website and content creator for the purpose of the page. For stores or websites that process financial transactions, examine the customer service information. **Important:** For personal content shared on social media platforms or forums, an alias or username is adequate. Next, assess the page to determine if the criteria for **Medium** apply: **Medium** Page Quality Assessment **Medium** Quality Criteria Quality of the MC MC created with adequate effort, originality, talent, or skill such that the page achieves its purpose. Reputation of the website and content creator Not especially positive nor especially negative: Reputation information found about the website or content creator is not concerning, but not positive enough to justify a higher rating. Trustworthiness of the page: E-E-A-T Adequate level of E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page.

#### 6.1 Types of Medium Quality Pages

## There are two types of **Medium** quality pages: Type of **Medium** Page **Description** **Nothing wrong, but nothing** **special** All of the **Medium** Page Quality considerations and criteria apply. **Mixed, but with some** **redeeming qualities** The page or website has some signs of **High** quality (E-E-A-T, quality of the MC, positive reputation), but also has one sign or mild signs of **Low** quality. **Important:** For a page to receive a rating higher than **Medium** , it must meet the criteria described in the next sections on **High** and **Highest** page quality. For a page to receive a rating lower than **Medium** , it must meet the criteria for **Low** or **Lowest** page quality. **Medium** is a rating that applies to many pages you will encounter in PQ rating tasks: many pages have nothing wrong, yet do not represent the high or highest quality content that's available online.

The topic of the page, the type of website, and the extent to which YMYL standards apply A page on any topic or any type of website may qualify for **High.** Give special scrutiny to pages on YMYL topics or websites needing a high level of trust, such as online stores. The title of the page **High** quality pages have titles that summarize the page. The role of Ads and SC on the page The Ads and SC do not block or significantly interfere with the MC on **High** quality pages. **Remember** : Many websites need monetization to share content with users. The presence or absence of Ads alone is not a consideration for PQ rating. Information provided by the website and content creator **High** quality pages have adequate information about the website and content creator for the purpose of the page. For stores or websites that process financial transactions, examine the customer service information. **Important:** For personal content shared on social media platforms or forums, an alias or username is adequate. Next, assess the page to determine if the criteria for **High** apply: **High** Page Quality Assessment **High** Quality Pages must demonstrate at least one of the following Quality of the MC MC created with a high level of effort, originality, talent, or skill such that the page achieves its purpose well. Reputation of the website and content creator Positive reputation of the website for the topic of the page. Positive reputation of the content creator for the topic of the MC. Trustworthiness of the page: E-E-A-T High level of E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page.

#### 7.1 High Quality Main Content

## **High** quality MC should be satisfying for people visiting the page. High quality MC shows evidence of effort, originality, talent, or skill. For informational pages, High quality MC must be accurate and consistent with well-established expert consensus when such consensus exists. Have high standards\! If you aren't sure whether the content is high quality, try finding other pages on the same topic to help calibrate your assessment: "typical" and "average" pages on a topic generally have Medium (not High) quality MC. To help develop your standards, here are some examples of **High** quality MC in contrast with **Low** quality MC: **High Quality MC: Details and Examples Low Quality MC: Details and Examples** **High level of effort:** The website or content creators worked hard to create content that achieves the purpose of the page. The MC is well-organized, edited, and curated to support the purpose. ● A news article with accuracy, depth, and clarity ● A Q\&A page or forum post with meaningful discussion by multiple participants ● A well-organized crafting tutorial page with clear, helpful instructions so that others can make the craft successfully **Low level of effort:** The MC shows signs of a lack of effort by the website or content creators. ● Lack of curation or editing: Content that helps the page achieve its purpose is mixed with less helpful distracting or filler content ● Lack of content creation: A forum post with little discussion or only superficial comments ● Lack of organization: A crafting tutorial page with lots of unhelpful "filler" at the top and little effort put into explaining how to make the craft (the purpose of the page) at the bottom **High originality** ● The MC is unique or original to the website ● Original photos or video footage produced by the website or content creator ● The content on the page is unique to the content creators, such as a personal perspective based on first-hand life experience **Low originality** ● Information is summarized from other sources with little added value ● Photos or videos come from other sources ● A summary of the perspectives of others, such as summarizing product reviews written by others **High level of talent or skill** ● The MC showcases the talent of the creator, e.g. a video of a talented content creator dancing ● The MC allows the page to achieve its purpose well because the content creator has talent or skill, e.g. a how-to article on plumbing by a skilled plumber **Low level of talent or skill** ● A lack of adequate talent or skill prevents the page from achieving its purpose, e.g. a how-to article on plumbing by someone who does not have the necessary skill to explain the steps accurately

#### 7.2 Positive Reputation

## Positive reputation of the website can be a reason for a **High** rating if the website is responsible for the MC. If the website is not responsible for the MC (e.g., posts on social media websites or forums), positive reputation of the content creator(s) can be a reason for the **High** rating. For non-YMYL topics, reputation information may be less formal. Popularity, user engagement, and user reviews can be considered evidence of reputation for non-YMYL websites: websites can be considered to have a positive reputation if they are popular and well-known for their topic or content type. **Remember:** Many smaller websites and ordinary people have little reputation information available. A page can still receive a **High** rating without reputation information.

#### 7.3 High Level of E-E-A-T

## Depending on the purpose of the page, topic, and type of website, a high level of E-E-A-T may be required for the page to achieve its purpose well and be considered **High** quality. Pages with **High** E-E-A-T are trustworthy or very trustworthy. **Experience** is valuable for almost any topic. Social media posts and forum discussions are often **High** quality when they involve people sharing their experience. From writing symphonies to reviewing home appliances, first-hand experience can make a social media post or discussion page **High** quality. **Expertise** is required for satisfying content on a variety of topics, from hobbies such as photography to YMYL topics such as tax preparation. Think about the topic of the page and what expertise is needed to create satisfying, trustworthy content. There are many types of informal expertise that may be visible in the MC itself. **Authoritative** pages of all types can be found. Government tax websites are an authoritative source for tax forms. Local businesses and organizations may be go-to sources for local information. When looking at a page or website, consider whether it is considered a go-to, authoritative source for the type of information it is displaying. **Trust** is especially important for **High** quality pages that involve processing financial transactions or cover YMYL topics. Even if the topic is not YMYL, trust may still be required; for example, product reviews and pages offering advice require at least some level of trust. While not all pages require a high level of trust, a trustworthy page is often a satisfying one. Think about the topic of the page. What kind of E-E-A-T is required for the page to achieve its purpose well?

## **Highest** quality pages serve a beneficial purpose and achieve that purpose very well. The distinction between **High** and **Highest** is based on the quality of MC, the reputation of the website and content creator, and/or E-E-A-T. To identify **Highest** quality pages, start by considering the following: Initial Consideration **Highest** Quality Pages The purpose of the page **Highest** quality pages have a beneficial purpose.

#### 8.1 Very High Quality MC

## Very high quality MC should be highly satisfying for people visiting the page. Very high quality MC shows evidence of a high level of effort, originality, talent, or skill. For informational pages, very high quality MC must be accurate, clearly communicated, and consistent with well-established expert consensus when it exists. Very high quality MC represents some of the most outstanding content on a topic or type that's available online. The standards for **Highest** quality MC may be very different depending on the purpose, topic, and type of website. Here are some examples of **Highest** quality original content: ● **For news** : Original reporting that provides information that would not otherwise have been known had the article not revealed it. Accurate, original, in-depth, and investigative reporting requires a high level of skill/talent and effort. Very high quality news content will include a description of primary sources and other original reporting referenced during the content creation process. Very high quality news content must be accurate and should meet professional journalistic standards. ● **For artistic content** (videos, images, photography, writing, etc.): Unique and original content created by highly skilled and talented artists or content creators. Such artistic content requires a high level of skill/talent and effort. If the artistic content is related to a YMYL topic (e.g., artistic content with the purpose of informing or swaying opinion about YMYL topics), YMYL standards should apply. ● **For informational content:** Original, accurate, comprehensive, clearly communicated, and should reflect expert consensus as appropriate. Expectations for different types of information may vary. For example, scientific papers have a different set of expectations than a social media post sharing information about a hobby such as stamp collecting. However, all types of very high quality informational content share common characteristics of accuracy and clarity of communication, in addition to meeting standards appropriate to the topic or field. The **Highest** rating may be justified for pages with very satisfying MC created with a very high level of effort, originality, talent, or skill.

#### 8.2 Very Positive Reputation

## Reputation research is important when giving **Highest** ratings. For YMYL topics, very positive reputation is often based on recommendations from known experts or professional societies appropriate to the topic of the page. Prestigious awards may be evidence as well, depending on the topic and type of content. For non-YMYL topics, reputation information may be less formal. Popularity, user engagement, and user reviews can be considered evidence of reputation for non-YMYL websites: websites and content creators can be considered to have a very positive reputation if they are seen as one of the best sources available online for a topic or type of content. **Remember:** Many smaller websites and ordinary people have little reputation information. A page can still receive a **Highest** rating without reputation information.

#### 8.3 Very High Level of E-E-A-T

## Very high E-E-A-T is a distinguishing factor for **Highest** quality pages. A website or content creator who is the uniquely authoritative, go-to source for a topic has very high E-E-A-T. A content creator with a wealth of experience may be considered to have very high E-E-A-T for topics where experience is the primary factor in trust. A very high level of expertise can justify a very high E-E-A-T assessment. Very high E-E-A-T websites and content creators are the most trusted sources on the internet for a particular topic. Think about what E-E-A-T means for the topic of the page. How important is first-hand experience? Who are the experts? What makes a source highly authoritative for the topic? What makes a website or content creator trustworthy for the topic? Standards for very high E-E-A-T will differ depending on the topic of the page.

## There are many encyclopedia-type websites. Some are highly-respected publications that are standard references, while some are websites with content created and edited by anonymous users, with no editorial oversight or fact checking. We may not always know the author of the specific encyclopedia article, and therefore must rely on website reputation research to determine the E-E-A-T of the article. **High** and **Highest** quality ratings should only be used for encyclopedias with very good reputations for accuracy and expertise, where the article itself is well-researched with appropriate references cited. A note about Wikipedia: in general, the website has a good reputation and is a very popular resource that is generally valued for accuracy. However, there is no single author or organization that vouches for the accuracy of Wikipedia articles, and the quality of pages varies. You should check individual articles to evaluate the quality of the MC. A Wikipedia article on a non-YMYL topic ( example ) with a satisfying amount of accurate information and trustworthy external references can usually be rated in the **High** range. A PQ rating in the **Medium** range is often appropriate for pages with less extensive MC and external references. Naturally, Wikipedia articles with very little MC should get lower PQ ratings. Factual inaccuracy is a sufficient reason for a **Low** or **Lowest** rating.

#### 9.2 Ratings for Pages with Error Messages or No MC

## In PQ rating tasks, you may encounter pages with error messages or other types of "broken" pages. Please think about whether the page offers help for users—did the website owner make an effort to ensure that users visiting the page have a good experience and get help finding what they are looking for? Pages with an explicit error (or custom 404\) message are often **Medium** quality, since they tend to clearly communicate that there's a problem and help users navigate to other/better pages on the website. A rating of **High** (or occasionally even **Highest** ) may be used for the rare error message page that involves a high level of effort and original content and provides a truly satisfying experience for users. Pages that are "broken" are often **Low** quality, because the broken aspect prevents them from achieving their purpose even if the problem is temporary and likely to be fixed later on by the website owner. However, sometimes "broken" pages should be rated **Lowest** if the problem is not temporary and instead is due to a systemic problem with the website. To differentiate between **Low** quality (temporarily broken) vs. **Lowest** quality (evidence of a systemic problem) pages, check other pages on the same website. If many other pages have the same problem, there is a systemic lack of effort on the part of the website owner that justifies the **Lowest** rating. Otherwise, use the **Low** rating to reflect the (hopefully temporary\!) issue with the MC on the page. Here are some examples: **Webpage/Type of Content Characteristics of the Page PQ Rating and Explanation** Lowest: Deliberately created with no MC (systemic problem) ● No MC ● Content created with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors This is an example of a page with no MC. You might think that the MC is “missing” due to a problem with this particular page, but in fact, this website has hundreds of pages that look the same—no MC, just Ads. This website shows Ads with little or no attempt to help users, and should be rated **Lowest** quality.

## **Webpage/Type of Content Characteristics of the Page PQ Rating and Explanation** Low: Page didn't fully load and has no MC (temporarily broken) ● No MC (probably due to a temporary technical error) ● Positive website reputation This page has no MC and no error message. It is an isolated example of a page with no MC or error message on a website for a reputable newspaper for a town in Michigan. All of the navigation links work, and the page was later fixed. This page can be viewed as lacking in effort (an error that was not caught before the page went live). Medium: Error page with custom 404 message ●^ Nothing wrong, but nothing special^ This is an example of a “custom 404” page, alerting users that the URL they are trying to visit no longer exists. Some websites do a nice job of alerting users about a problem and providing helpful tips. This page is on a well-known merchant website with a good reputation. However, this particular page displays the bare minimum of content needed to explain the problem to users, and the only helpful content is a link to the homepage. High: Error page with custom 404 message ● Satisfying MC: achieves the purpose of the page well ● Positive website reputation This is an example of a “custom 404” page, alerting users that the URL they are trying to visit no longer exists. This website does a nice job of explaining the issue and providing helpful tips, including a search box. Highest: Error page with custom 404 message ● Very satisfying MC: achieves the purpose of the page very well ● Very positive website reputation This is an example of a “custom 404” page. These pages are designed to alert users that the URL they are trying to visit no longer exists. The MC of this page is the cartoon, the caption, and the search functionality, which is specific to the content of the website. It is clear that effort and talent was involved in the creation of the MC. This publication has a very positive reputation and is specifically known for its cartoons, which allows us to go as high as High+ to Highest. This is among the most clever, original, and satisfying custom 404 messages that can be found online\!

#### 9.3 Ratings for Forums and Q\&A Pages

## Ratings for forum and Q\&A pages can be challenging. Here is some guidance on how to approach these pages: **● The Main Content includes the question, the answers/responses, and the resulting discussions.** ● **Rate from the point of view of a user who visits the page** , rather than a participant involved in the discussion. ● **Users who post answers/responses or comments are often identified only by a username or alias.** A page can be **High** or **Highest** quality with just usernames or aliases depending on other criteria. ● **The E-E-A-T of a discussion among users can often be judged by the posts or comments themselves.** ○ For some topics, Experience is the most important dimension of Trust. For other topics, assessing Expertise through the posts may be important. In some cases, the posters themselves will highlight either their own Experience or Expertise, or other people will comment on it. ○ Pages on YMYL topics require more attention to Trust and more care in the assessment of E-E-A-T. ● **Highest quality forum/Q\&A pages** have extremely satisfying conversations, including participation from users who have put a great deal of effort into their posts and have a wealth of Experience and/or Expertise on the topic. Such conversations can be very satisfying because of the depth of discussion, the unique insights, or the sharing of experiences that many would not have access to in their real-world community. ● **Low quality forum/Q\&A pages** often lack effort (few responses, surface-level rather than in-depth discussion), lack Experience or Expertise, contain mild inaccuracies, or show a significant lack of respect or decorum among the participants that might deter others from joining the discussion. ● **Lowest quality forum/Q\&A pages** may contain information or advice that is harmfully misleading, contradicts well-established expert consensus, encourages harm towards self or other individuals/participants, etc. One challenge is rating pages with little to no participation, and/or no answer to an open question: ● A *new* page or *recently started* discussion that consists only of a question or initial post by a person should generally be rated **Medium** unless there are other low quality attributes. These pages may need time to achieve their purpose. ● Over time, no participation in a discussion (or only superficial discussion) and/or no meaningful answer to an open question may be a reason for a **Low** quality rating, especially in the presence of other low quality attributes. Another challenge occurs when the discussion on the page drifts, becomes combative, or becomes dominated by misleading or spammy content. When rating, value the insightful, meaningful discussion that exists. If the page is a mix of high and low quality characteristics but has insightful, meaningful discussion, the **Medium** rating may be most appropriate as long as the page is not potentially harmful. Here are some examples:

## **Webpage/Type of Content Characteristics of the Page PQ Rating and Explanation** Lowest: Q\&A page about chest pains and smoking ● **Harmfully Misleading Information:** Contains inaccurate and potentially dangerous medical advice about a YMYL topic Information about chest pain and smoking could significantly impact people’s decisions to seek medical treatment. This page is on a YMYL topic. This page must be evaluated from the point of view of a user visiting this page from a search engine, rather than a participant. The question is poorly worded and difficult to understand. There aren't many responses. One response correctly warns about the danger of smoking cigarettes but suggests smoking marijuana instead. Another response suggests that it's fine to keep smoking and that aspirin can be used to address pain. The last response lacks respect: it asks if the person who asked the original question is stupid. The answers have incorrect and potentially dangerous medical advice, making it lowest quality MC. Low: Q\&A page about a 2002 Volvo part ● Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page: does not achieve the purpose well ● Misleading page design Please read the MC (areas with red boxes around it), including the completely unhelpful "answer." This answer is so unhelpful, we can consider this question to be unanswered. This page has an unsatisfying amount of MC. In addition to a very unhelpful “answer,” the page design makes it difficult to distinguish the MC from Ads. For example, below the answer, we see a "sponsored answer," which has the same format as the real answer, but is actually an Ad and not an answer to the question—this is a misleading page design. Medium: Forum page with a new question, posted by a person **Nothing wrong, nothing special** ● Real in-depth question, posted very recently ● No one has responded (yet) Forums rely on user engagement to create satisfying MC. In this case, a real person has posted a question that can lead to good discussion. The question is only hours old (at the time this example was created). For new questions, discussions and threads, a Medium rating is appropriate if there are no low quality characteristics but also no opportunity for discussion yet.

## **Webpage/Type of Content Characteristics of the Page PQ Rating and Explanation** Medium: Forum page on an online auction website **Mixed, but with some redeeming qualities:** ● High E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page ● Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page: does not achieve the purpose well The relative lack of effort/participation in the discussion and depth of the MC is balanced by the high E-E-A-T of this forum. This forum is dedicated to this kind of question and therefore has a high level of expertise. Medium: Forum page on how to wash ballet shoes **Mixed, but with some redeeming qualities:** ● Adequate MC: achieves the purpose of the page ● Ads or SC significantly distract from or interrupt the use of MC ● High E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page This forum is about dance topics, and many pages have expertise from a community of ballet dancers. On this particular page, participants have first-hand experience washing ballet shoes and make recommendations based on their own experiences. This page is “mixed” because there is some distracting content that makes it hard to read the MC. However, this is not a beauty contest\! Even though the page may be cluttered, there is some valuable E-E-A-T and helpful MC, making Medium a good rating for this page. High: Forum post on the magic loop technique in knitting ● MC is satisfying for the purpose of the page: demonstrates effort, originality, talent, or skill ● High E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page The person who posted the first message on this forum page provides a helpful resource on how to master the magic loop technique in knitting (effort, skill). She also shares pictures of her own version using an old pair of blue jeans (original content). With over 20 years of experience knitting socks, we would consider her to be an expert on the topic. High: Q\&A page about whether a Roomba will work ● Satisfying MC: achieves the purpose of the page well ● High E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page Many participants share their personal experiences with these products, giving details such as how well certain models work with pet hair (effort, first-hand experience, original content). There are many descriptions of participants’ own experiences with this product and how well it works for them, making the MC satisfying for the purpose of the page.

## **Webpage/Type of Content Characteristics of the Page PQ Rating and Explanation** High: Forum page on authenticating a purse ● Satisfying MC: achieves the purpose of the page well ● Positive website reputation for the topic of the page ● High E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page This forum is a go-to source for discussions on luxury designer purses (positive website reputation, experience, expertise, "go-to" authority). On this particular forum page, members are consulting forum experts who have expertise authenticating bags from this brand. These experts can tell if a particular bag is authentic or fake. The quality of the MC is high due to the level of effort, skill, and engagement among those who participate in the forum. While there is an ad at the top and a few ads within the forum message, it does not distract from the MC, which is easy to find. High: Forum page on landscaping an aquarium ● Satisfying MC: achieves the purpose of the page well ● High E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page This discussion focuses on the landscaping for a particular paludarium (an aquarium with terrestrial and aquatic elements). There is a lot of discussion and interaction between forum members about the types of materials and species used in the aquarium (effort, original or unique content). The posts show expertise in a niche topic aquarium landscaping (experience, expertise). Highest: Q\&A page about how long most cancer patients live ● Very satisfying MC: achieves the purpose of the page very well ● Positive website reputation for the topic of the page ● Very high E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page How long a person may live with a disease could significantly impact life decisions. This is a YMYL topic. This is a Q\&A page on a medical question that is well-answered by non-experts with life experience. There are many responses describing how long a loved one lived after diagnosis. The focus of the page is experience, not medical advice. Many responses are based on personal experience and are helpful for this topic. Highest: Q\&A page on abbreviations ● Satisfying MC: achieves the purpose of the page well ● Very positive website reputation for the topic of the page ● Very high E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page The purpose of the page is to answer questions about the usage of abbreviations, and it contains helpful information about common abbreviation issues. This website has a very good reputation as a reference for information on writing, publishing, etc. It is considered highly authoritative and trustworthy for the topic of the page.

### 10.0 Page Quality Rating Tasks

## At first, PQ rating may seem difficult. There are several aspects of the page and the website to look at and think about. **Important** : Do not struggle with each PQ rating. Please give your best rating and move on. If you are having trouble deciding between two ratings, use the lower rating. If you are torn between three ratings, choose the one in the middle. Do not consider the country or location of the page or website for PQ rating. For example, English (US) raters should use the same PQ standards when rating pages from other English language websites (UK websites, Canadian websites, etc.) as they use when rating pages from U.S. websites. In other words, English (US) raters should not lower the PQ rating because the page location (UK, Canada) does not match the task location. These guidelines are specific to "regular" webpages. Occasionally, you may be asked to rate a landing page that is not a webpage. For example, you may be asked to rate a PDF file, a PNG or JPEG image file, etc. When the landing page of the URL is not a webpage, some of the criteria in these guidelines may not apply. In this case, please use your judgment. Finally, this Page Quality Rating Guideline does not completely cover every aspect of page quality. If you find pages that you truly believe to be **High** or **Low** quality, please rate them as such, even if the reason is based on something not covered in these guidelines. Please use the comment section to explain your reasoning. As always, use your judgment.

#### 10.1 Instructions for Rating Page Quality Tasks

## **The Page Quality task page is broken up into several parts:**

1. ## Some initial questions about the task landing page.

2. ## A “PQ grid” to record your observations about PQ characteristics of the landing page.

3. ## The Overall PQ rating slider which records your Overall PQ rating.

4. ## A comment box to explain your rating.    Some results to the initial questions will end the task early. If the page is Porn, Foreign Language, Did Not Load, or    consists of restricted or inaccessible MC (e.g., subscription is required to view MC), you will not fill in the PQ grid or assign    an overall rating.    ● **Foreign Language** should not be used when the language on the landing page is in the task language, a    language that is commonly used by a significant percentage of the population in the task location, or English.    ● **Did Not Load** should be used for pages where there is absolutely no content on the page created by the website.    There is no MC, SC, or Ads on the page. See this Wikipedia article for descriptions of different types of error    messages.    The PQ grid is designed to be your "note pad." It allows you to record your observations about the landing page and the    website it belongs to.

### 11.0 Page Quality Rating FAQs

## Question Answer

## Why do we have to do all

## these steps? This takes a

## long time\!

## With practice, the amount of time needed for accurate PQ ratings will decrease. The

## steps are important and are designed to help you assess many different aspects of PQ.

## You may be surprised by what you find. Pages that initially look Low quality may turn

## out to be Medium or High quality with careful inspection. The reverse may happen as

## well. We want your most informed, thoughtful opinion.

## Are we just giving High

## quality ratings to pages that

## “look” good?

## No\! The goal is to do the exact opposite. These steps are designed to help you

## analyze the page without using a superficial “does it look good?” approach.

## Is sharing a personal

## experience or opinion a

## beneficial purpose? What if

## the personal opinion is

## upsetting or offensive?

## Sharing a personal experience or opinion can be a beneficial purpose as it allows

## people to appreciate different perspectives. Content on the Internet can help people

## understand why others think and feel the way they do.

## It can be valuable to see the opinions and perspectives of others, even when they are

## off-putting, distasteful, upsetting, or offensive to you personally. Apply the standards of

## these guidelines rather than your own personal opinions or views.

## However, sometimes opinions and perspectives can spread misleading information or

## otherwise have the potential to cause harm. Therefore, apply the standards in these

## guidelines to all types of pages and content.

## Remember : Your assessment of harm happens before and overrides other

## considerations such as the life experience or expertise of the content creator.

## Can life experience justify a

## Highest quality rating for a

## page on a YMYL topic?

## Factual information and advice on YMYL topics should come from experts. Sharing life

## experience on YMYL topics can be Highest quality, but it must be trustworthy, safe,

## consistent with well-established expert consensus, and speak to topics that life

## experience is valuable for.

## For example, information about when and where to vote is a YMYL topic. It's possible

## to have a Highest quality page that shares life experience about voting, such as an

## inspiring personal post about becoming a citizen and voting for the first time. However,

## if a page about someone's voting experience gives inaccurate information about when

## and where to vote either deliberately or through careless oversight, the page should be

## rated Lowest because it could cause others to miss the opportunity to vote.

## You talked about expertise

## when rating MC. Does

## expertise matter for all

## topics? Aren't there some

## topics for which there are

## no experts?

## Remember that we are not just talking about formal expertise. Informal expertise is

## equally important, and for some topics may be a more common type of E-E-A-T.

## For most page purposes and topics, you can find experts even when the field itself is

## niche or non-mainstream. For example, there are expert alternative medicine websites

## created by leading practitioners of acupuncture, herbal therapy, etc. There are also

## pages about alternative medicine written by people with no expertise or experience.

## E-E-A-T should differentiate between these two scenarios.

## Reminder : If the page is harmful to people or society, untrustworthy, or spammy as

## defined in these guidelines, expertise and experience doesn't matter. It should be rated

## Lowest.

## 

## **Question Answer** **When I think about E-E-A-T,** **it seems like expertise and** **experience overlap a lot.** **What's the difference?** Here's one way to think about it: ● **Expertise** often involves objective, testable knowledge or skills, for example: can you calculate the load bearing weight of a bridge? ● **Experience** can be more subjective and is often shared through personal narration, for example: how does it feel to experience love for another person? For PQ rating, it's not important to distinguish between expertise and experience. Instead, focus on what kind of content is trustworthy and satisfying for the purpose of the page. You may find that both expertise and experience can be trustworthy and satisfying for the same topic. For example, a medical website may be a trustworthy source for treatment options, and the experiences of other people who have gone through treatment may provide emotional support and prepare you for what to expect. **Aren't some types of pages** **always Low quality, such as** **celebrity gossip?** For almost any type of page or informational topic, there is a range of content quality. For example, there are both **High** and **Low** quality celebrity gossip pages. The purpose of these pages is to share interesting, accurate information about celebrities. There may be benefits in celebrity stories that inspire others or help people going through similar challenges. A celebrity gossip page is **High** quality if it has accurate and interesting information, has no characteristics of Low or Lowest quality, and comes from a reasonably reliable source. **I've never seen a High** **quality page of type X. If** **there are no high quality** **pages of this type, why are** **we giving existing pages a** **Low quality rating?** For some topics or types of pages, there may not be many (or any\!) High quality pages now, but there may be in the future. We need a uniform set of standards that apply to all pages, even for pages that have not yet been created. **Some of these criteria seem** **unfair. For example, some** **art pages do not have a** **purpose. Are these pages** **Low quality?** Art pages do have a purpose: artistic expression. Pages created for artistic expression do not deserve the **Low** quality rating simply because they have no other purpose. Artistic expression, humor, entertainment, sharing photos and videos, etc. are all valid and beneficial page purposes. **How should interstitials** **factor into my rating?** Sometimes clicking on the task URL will bring up an interstitial page. You can ignore this page in your rating criteria if you can easily get to the MC. However, if the interstitial makes it extremely hard (or impossible) to get to the MC and evaluate how well the page achieves its purpose, that should factor into your PQ rating.

## Part 2: Understanding Search User Needs

### 12.0 Understanding Search Users, Queries, and Results

## Why do people search the Internet? People use Internet search engines to perform many different tasks in different environments using different types of devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, or computers. Keep in mind that searches can be simple or complex, and the underlying task that a person is trying to accomplish may take multiple steps to complete. For example, a simple task may be to find the director of a movie. A complex task may be to find a movie’s showtimes nearby, purchase tickets, and get directions to go to the theater. Overall, search engines should make it easy for people to complete tasks by surfacing helpful results right away.

#### 12.1 Important Rating Definitions and Ideas

## **User:** A person who is searching. People search everywhere: people in all countries, speaking all languages; people of all ages, genders, races, religions, political affiliations, etc. **Query** : The text, image and/or other content that a user enters in a search engine search box or search app to do a search. In these guidelines, queries have square brackets around them to look like a search box. If a user says “coffee shops near me,” we display: \[coffee shops near me\]. If a user types “flights to New York” in the search box, we display: \[flights to New York\]. Queries may be spoken, typed, copied and pasted, come directly from a camera or other app, and/or be related searches that appear in search results. There are many different types of queries because people use search to do many things, from searching for specific websites to looking for answers to questions to browsing videos for inspiration to searching with an image to figure out where to buy a product. **Query interpretation** : The possible meaning(s) of the query or what the query may refer to. Many queries have more than one meaning. For example, the query \[apple\] might refer to the computer brand or the fruit or something else. **User Intent** : What the user is trying to accomplish when they search. For example, if a user searches for a movie, they may be interested in showtimes, reviews, cast, etc. For a specific query interpretation, there may be many possible user intents. A single user may have many different intents for a single query\!

## **Locale** : All queries have a locale, which is the language and region for the task. Regions are represented by a two-letter country code, for example, "US" in the locale "English (US)". For a current list of country codes, click here. We sometimes refer to the locale as the task location. **User Location** : Sometimes more specific information about the location of the person searching is provided, usually a city or state. In rating tasks, this information may be shown on a map. User location is very important for understanding the query and what results are helpful for searches related to nearby places, such as \[coffee shops near me\]. For other searches such as \[how does gravity work\], user location is not important at all, as gravity works the same way everywhere. **Search Engine Results Page (SERP):** The page a search engine shows after a user enters a query in the search box. The SERP is made up of **result blocks**. **Result** : We will use the word **result** to refer to the result block *and* the landing page. ● **Result Block:** This is an individual “block” that appears on the user’s device in response to the query. The result block may display information in the block itself or contain links, or may do both. ● The **Landing Page** ( **LP** ) is the page you see after you click a link in the result block.

#### 12.2 Understanding the Query

## Understanding the query is the first step in evaluating the task. Remember, a query is what a user types or speaks into their device. Some tasks include a query research link, which you should use if you don’t understand the query or user intent. Otherwise, please do web research using Google or an online dictionary or encyclopedia. If you still don’t understand the query or user intent, please release the task. **Important** : If you research the query on Google, please do not rely on the top results on the SERP. A query may have other meanings not represented on Google’s search results pages. Do not assign a high rating to a webpage just because it appears at the top of a list of search results on Google. Think about users in your locale typing or speaking the following queries into their phone. **Query User Intent** \[population of paris\], English (US) Find the current population of Paris, France. \[starbucks near me\], English (US) Find the nearest Starbucks location. \[weather\], English (US) Find weather information in the user location right now.

#### 12.3 Locale and User Location

## All queries have a task language and task location (referred to in rating tasks as the "Locale"). The locale is important for understanding the query and user intent. Users in different locales may have different expectations for the same query. Some tasks show a user location in addition to a locale. However, for many or most queries in a given locale, the user location does not change our understanding of the query and user intent. Here are some examples: \[facebook.com\], \[pictures of kittens\], \[distance between the earth and the moon\]. When is the locale or user location important in understanding query interpretation and user intent? Please use both web research and your personal judgment to answer this question. Ask yourself, “Would people in one city or country be looking for something different than people in another city or country?”

#### 12.4 Queries with an Explicit Location

## Sometimes people tell search engines exactly what kinds of results they are looking for by adding the desired location in the query, regardless of their own location. We'll call this location inside the query the “explicit location.” The explicit location makes queries much easier to understand and interpret.  “My mom is coming to visit. I need to find a hotel for her nearby” Query: \[ Dallas hotels\] Locale: English (US) User Location: Dallas,TX Explicit Location: Dallas  “I need a hotel for my trip to New York” Query: \[ New York hotels\] Locale: English (US) User Location: Dallas,TX Explicit Location: New York Sometimes the explicit location matches the user location or locale, and sometimes it doesn't. When there is an explicit location in the query, pay attention to it\! People use explicit locations to indicate exactly what they are looking for.

#### 12.5 Queries with Multiple Meanings

## Many queries have more than one meaning. For example, the query \[apple\] might refer to the computer brand or the fruit. We will call these possible meanings **query interpretations**. **Dominant Interpretation** : The *dominant interpretation* of a query is what most users mean when they type the query. Not all queries have a dominant interpretation. The dominant interpretation should be clear to you, especially after doing a little web research. **Common Interpretation** : A *common interpretation* of a query is what many or some users mean when they type a query. A query can have multiple common interpretations. **Minor Interpretation** : Sometimes you will find less common interpretations. These are interpretations that fewer users have in mind. We will call these *minor interpretations*. ● **Reasonable minor interpretations** : Reasonable minor interpretations may help fewer users, but they still are helpful to have in a set of results because different users may want different things. ● **Unlikely minor interpretations** : An unlikely minor interpretation is an interpretation that is in theory possible but is very unlikely \- very few users are likely to have this in mind. **No chance interpretation** : An interpretation so unlikely that almost no user would have this in mind. Results for no chance interpretations feel off-topic even if they match the query words. For example, almost no one wants a result about an overheated pet for the English US query \[hot dog\].

## **Query: \[apple\]** **Locale: English (US)** Note: There are many interpretations for this query; only a few are shown for the purposes of this example. Computer company Fruit Person’s name City **Dominant Interpretation Common Interpretations Unlikely Minor Interpretation** **Query: \[mercury\]** **Locale: English (US)** Note: There are many interpretations for this query; only a few are shown for the purposes of this example. Planet Chemical Element Insurance company Boat engine company British aircraft designed during WWII **Common Interpretations** **Reasonable Minor** **Interpretations** **Unlikely Minor Interpretations**

## Some queries have few possible interpretations or intents because the query specifically states what users are looking for. Here are some examples: **Query User Location** **Reasonable query** **Interpretation/User Intent** **Not a reasonable query** **interpretation or user intent** \[lewis county non emergency number\] Centralia, WA, USA Users are looking for a non-emergency number for help in Lewis County, WA. An emergency number for Lewis County is not a reasonable minor intent. Pay attention to important words in the user query, in this case, “non emergency”. Users can become frustrated when results ignore important words. \[is egg salad healthy\] NA Users are looking for health information about egg salad, such as calories, fat, and the healthfulness of eggs and other common egg salad ingredients, etc. Recipes for egg salad ( that do not include any nutritional information about egg salad) are not a reasonable minor intent for this health information search. People may be interested in recipes as a next step, but the user issuing the query is specifically looking for health information, not food preparation. Some recipes may mention the query topic (such as healthier egg salad alternatives), but not actually answer the user’s query. Pay attention to what users want and need for a search. \[can bears climb mountains\]

###### NA

## Users are looking for the answer to

## a know-simple question about the

## climbing ability of bears.

## Learning about mountain climbing

## opportunities in Bears Ears national

## monument is not a reasonable minor

## intent.

## Just because a result matches

## several key words in the query does

## not mean it is relevant or helpful to

## the user.

## 

#### 12.6 Query Meanings Can Change Over Time

## Remember to think about the query and its current meaning as you are rating. We will assume users are looking for current information about a topic, the most recent product model, the most recent occurrence of a recurring event, etc., unless otherwise specified by the query. **User in 1994 User in 2004** 41 st^ US president  Query: \[George Bush\] Locale: English (US) 43 rd^ US president  Query: \[George Bush\] Locale: English (US) **User in 2007 User in 2022** iphone 1  Query: \[iphone\] Locale: English (US) iphone 13  Query: \[iphone\] Locale: English (US) The interpretation of the query \[iphone\], English (US) has changed over time as new iPhone models are released. The first iPhone was introduced in 2007\. Users searching for \[iphone\], English (US) at that time were looking for the new (at the time) first iPhone model. Most users now are looking for the most recent or upcoming iPhone model. In the future, new models will come out and the dominant interpretation will change again.

#### 12.7 Understanding User Intent

## It can be helpful to think of queries as having one or more of the following intents. ● **Know** query, some of which are **Know Simple** queries ● **Do** query, when the user is trying to accomplish a goal or engage in an activity ● **Website** query, when the user is looking for a specific website or webpage ● **Visit-in-person** query, some of which are looking for a specific business or organization, some of which are looking for a category of businesses

##### 12.7.1 Know and Know Simple Queries

## The intent of a **Know** query is to find information or explore a topic. Users want to **Know** more about something. **Know Simple** queries are a special type of **Know** query. **Know Simple** queries seek a very specific answer, like a fact, diagram, etc. This answer has to be correct and complete, and can be displayed in a relatively small amount of space. As a general rule, if most people would agree on a correct answer, and it would fit in 1-2 sentences or a short list of items, the query can be called a **Know Simple** query. **Know Simple** queries may be questions such as \[how tall is barack obama\]. Frequently, **Know Simple** queries do not have question words. For example, \[barack obama height\] has the same user intent as \[how tall is barack obama\], but is not in a question format. Most queries are *not* **Know Simple** queries, such as: ● Broad, complex, and/or in-depth informational queries that do not have a short answer ● Ambiguous or unclear informational queries ● Informational queries on controversial topics ● Informational queries with no definitive “right answer” ● Queries where different users may want different types of information, or different sources of information ● Queries where users want to browse or explore a topic ● Queries where users want to find inspiration or ideas related to a topic ● Queries where users are seeking personal opinions and perspectives from real people Here are some examples where the **Know Simple** query asks for a simple fact, which can be answered correctly and completely in a small amount of space, and the **Know** query answer is more complex. **Know Simple Query Know Query Explanation** \[barack obama height\] \[how tall is obama\] \[barack obama\]^ The **Know** query is a broad information query and different users may be looking for different things (e.g., biography, books, social media posts, etc.). \[new york city population 2013\] \[new york city\] The **Know** query is a broad information query and different users may be looking for different things (e.g., tourist and trip planning information, facts, photographs, history). \[who is graves disease named after\] \[graves disease\]^ The **Know** query is a broad query for medical information and different users may have different needs. There is no single “answer” for this query. \[macy’s store hours\] \[macy’s gift wrap options\] The **Know** query is a broad query for a particular service offered by a department store, and does not have a short answer. \[what is the symbol for the element nickel\] \[what nickel is used for\] The^^ **Know**^^ query is a broad query and there is no short,^ complete answer. \[who won the 2014 bcs national championship game\] \[who is going to win the bcs national championship game\] The **Know** query asks for an opinion and there is no definitive answer. \[what is starbucks stock price\] \[should i invest in starbucks stock\] Even though the **Know** query is theoretically a yes/no question, there is not a single answer that everyone would agree on.

## Know Simple Query Know Query Explanation

## \[weather\]

## \[how do people predict the

## weather\]

## The query \[weather\] may seem like a broad information

## query, but most people likely have a fairly simple

## informational need: to find the current or upcoming

## temperature, and the chance of local weather events such as

## rain or snow. Therefore, consider queries like \[weather\],

## \[weather today\], \[weather tomorrow\], \[weather this week\] to

## be Know Simple queries.

## In contrast, the Know query is a broad information query and

## different users may be looking for different things.

## \[what is a bowl cut\] \[hair styles for men with round faces\]

## Users who issue the Know query are likely seeking

## inspiration for a new hair style. There is no definitive right

## answer for this query.

## \[what is the social security

## retirement age\] \[retirement planning\]^

## The Know query is about a complicated and situational topic.

## Many users would issue this query with the intent of broadly

## exploring the topic, and different users would be better

## served by different information.

## 

##### 12.7.2 Do Queries

## The intent of a **Do** query is to accomplish a goal or engage in an activity. The goal or activity may be to download, to buy, to obtain, to be entertained by, or to interact with a website or app. **Do** queries may have a specific need to be immediately accomplished or they may be more open ended and involve browsing and subsequent searches to ultimately accomplish the goal. Note that the line between Do and Know queries is sometimes blurry, with some queries fitting into both categories. Don't worry about strictly differentiating between these two categories. They're given to illustrate some big-picture patterns in user intents, and many queries do not fit neatly into one and only one of these categories. Here are some examples of Do Queries. **Query Likely User Intent** \[get my GED online\] Obtain U.S. high school equivalency diploma online. \[online personality test\] Take an online personality test. \[what is my bmi?\] Calculate BMI (body mass index). \[pay parking ticket\] Pay for a parking ticket. \[watch stranger things\] Watch the TV show “Stranger Things”. \[shape of you video\] Watch the music video for the song “Shape of You” by Ed Sheeran \[music videos\] The user did not ask for a specific music video, but this query still has a likely Do intent because the user most likely issued the query with the intent of watching at least one music video after browsing options in the search results. \[small bathroom organization ideas\] Browse the web for ideas on ways to organize a small bathroom Note: This is an open-ended Do query where different kinds of content could be helpful. Some users may want to browse images and video to find visual inspiration, some may want to read how-to guides, and others may be interested in both.

##### 12.7.3 Website Queries

## The intent of a **Website** query is to locate a specific website or webpage that users have requested. This single webpage is called the **target** of the query. One type of **Website** query is a URL Query, which can be: ● Exact, perfectly-formed, working URLs, such as \[http://www.ibm.com\] or \[www.ibm.com\] or \[ibm.com\]. ● Imperfect URL queries: Queries that look like URL queries, but are not “working URLs”. These URLs do not load if you type or paste them into your browser address bar. Even so, we believe users have a specific page in mind. Here are some examples. **Query Likely User Intent** \[reddit login\] View the login page for Reddit. \[tiktok\] View the TikTok website. \[yahoo mail\] View the Yahoo Mail website. \[walmart.com\] View the Walmart website. \[feathermobility.com feather 13.5 lbs. wheelchair\] View the Feather 13.5 lbs. wheelchair product page on the Feather Chair website.

##### 12.7.4 Visit-in-Person Queries and User Location

## People use search engines to look for **Visit-in-Person** information, such as finding nearby coffee shops, gas stations, ATMs, restaurants, etc. Some queries clearly “ask” for nearby information or nearby results (e.g., businesses, organizations, other nearby places). Some queries are not asking for nearby information or nearby results. Here are some examples. **Queries with Visit-in-Person Intent Query with Non-Visit-in-Person Intent**  “I want to find a car repair shop.” Query: \[car repair shop\] Locale: English (US)  “How tall is Mount Everest?” Query: \[how tall is mt everest\] Locale: English (US)  “I need to find a gas station right away\!” Query: \[gas stations\] Locale: English (US)  “I would like to take an IQ test online.” Query: \[iq test\] Locale: English (US) **More examples** : \[pizza\], \[yoga class\], \[grocery stores\], \[movie showtimes\], \[car repair\], \[dentists\], \[bank of america atm locations\], \[library near me\] **More examples** : \[boston red sox\], \[scrabble cheat\], \[definition of sedentary\], \[aapl\], \[beyonce\], \[minecraft\], \[small dog breeds\], \[dance videos\], \[oscars\], \[silly jokes\], \[bank of america login\]

## And some queries could go either way. Some users may want nearby results and others may not.  “I want to go to a Walmart near me.” Query: \[walmart\] Locale: English (US)  “I want to shop online on the Walmart website” Query: \[walmart\] Locale: English (US) Here are some examples of queries with both visit-in-person and non-visit-in-person intent: ● \[hotels\] ● \[post office\] ● \[h\&m\] ● \[library\] ● \[bank of america\] ● \[the gap\] Sometimes, the user location can change our understanding of the query. For users close to Austin, Texas, the query \[verbena\] could have two different interpretations: a popular restaurant named Verbena or the plant verbena.  “What is the address of Verbena?” Query: \[verbena\] Locale: English (US) User Location: Austin,TX  “I want to learn more about the plant verbena.” Query: \[verbena\] Locale: English (US) User Location: Austin, TX

## In most other user locations, there is no restaurant (or anything else) named Verbena and there is just one interpretation of the query \[verbena\]: the plant. The Austin restaurant is not well-known outside of Austin, TX.  “I want to learn more about the plant verbena.” Query: \[verbena\] Locale: English (US) User Location: Flint, MI Use your common sense when thinking about queries and whether they have possible visit-in-person intent.

##### 12.7.5 Queries with Multiple User Intents

## Many queries have more than one likely user intent. Please use your judgment when determining if a particular intent is reasonable for queries with multiple intents. Because so many people search for so many things, err on the side of considering interpretations and intents to be reasonable and doing query research as needed. **Query Examples of Reasonable User Intent Examples of Unlikely User Intent** \[harvard\] Depending on the user need and location, users may want to visit the official homepage ( **Website** ), get directions ( **Visit-in-Person** ), or learn more information about the school such as the application process or history, see recent news, or updates on sporting events ( **Know** ). This query is very broad. Different people may be looking for different things. However, it's fairly unlikely that someone is looking for a one specific Harvard course such as "The Science and Psychology of Music" for the broad query \[harvard\]. \[walmart\] Users may want to go to a nearby Walmart ( **Visit-in-Person** ) or view the homepage to shop online ( **Website** ). Some users may want to learn more information about the company or see recent news, social media posts, etc ( **Know** ). This query is very broad. Different people may be looking for different things. However, it's fairly unlikely that someone is looking for a news article on Walmart's charitable donations from 2001 for the query \[walmart\].

#### 12.8 Understanding Result Blocks

## The following sections contain examples of different types of queries and results.

##### 12.8.1 Web Search Result Block Examples

## Web Search Result Blocks typically have a title link, a URL and a “snippet” of text describing the page. For many queries, Web Search Result Blocks are the most helpful type of result. **Query and User Intent Web Search Result Block** **Query:** \[cuisinart food processor reviews\] **User Intent:** This is a **Know** query. The user wants to find recent reviews of Cuisinart food processors. **Result:** This is a Web Search Result Block that has a link to a landing page with Cuisinart reviews. **Query:** \[broadway tickets\] **User Intent:** This is a **Know** query or **Do** query. The user wants to search prices and/or purchase tickets to a Broadway show in New York City.

##### 12.8.2 Special Content Result Block Examples

## Special Content Result Blocks (SCRBs) appear in the search results page, along with Web Search Result Blocks. Special Content Result Blocks are designed to show content directly to users on the search results page. From working calculators to playable videos to interactive weather information, these results help users immediately get information or content. Some SCRBs may also have links to landing pages. **Important** : Please assume that any interactive features work and function properly. Some notes: ● All result blocks are “screenshots” or images of search results with prominent links enabled. Unfortunately, a screenshot or image of an interactive result block will not function as it would for a real user. **For the purpose of** **rating, please assume that interactive result blocks do function as intended**. Try to interact with the result block as some links, buttons, or other features may work. ● There may be a delay between when the rating task is created and when you actually rate the block, causing some information in special content result blocks to be a few hours or even days out of date. Stock price or weather informational blocks are designed to give users extremely current and timely information. However, due to a delay in rating time, the information may no longer be accurate. Don’t penalize a special content result block for being out of date. **Assume that the blocks show current information for users, unless instructed** **otherwise.** **Query and User Intent Special Content Result Block** **Query:** \[weather\] **User Location:** Chicago, Illinois **User Intent:** This is a **Know Simple** query since users have a fairly simple informational need: find the current temperature and chance of rain or snow. The user wants to know the weather for the User Location. **Note:** Assume the block shows current information for users.

## **Query and User Intent Special Content Result Block** **Query:** \[emma stone movies\] **User Intent:** This is a **Know** query. The user wants to get information on movies with Emma Stone. **Result:** In this result block, users can immediately see some popular movies starring Emma Stone, with an option to click on the links to learn more about each movie. Users can also swipe to see a list of more movies. **Query:** \[calories in a banana\] **User Intent:** This is a **Know Simple** query. The user wants to find out how many calories are in a banana.

## **Query and User Intent Special Content Result Block** **Query:** \[NFL scores\] **User Intent:** This is a **Know** query. The user wants to find the most recent National Football League scores. **Query:** \[coldplay fix you video\] **User Intent:** This is a **Do** query. The user wants to watch the music video for the song “Fix You” by Coldplay. **Result:** By clicking on this result block, users can play the music video for the song, learn more about the artist/album, etc.

## **Query and User Intent Special Content Result Block** **Query:** \[what is the tallest tree\] **User Intent:** This is a **Know Simple** query. The user wants to know what type of tree is the tallest.

## Part 3: Needs Met Rating Guideline

### 13.0 Rating Using the Needs Met Scale

## There are many different kinds of queries and results, but the process of rating is the same: **Needs Met rating tasks ask** **you to focus on user needs and think about how helpful and satisfying the result is for the users**. This is what the Needs Met rating slider looks like: **Rating Description** **Fully Meets (FullyM)** A special rating category, which only applies to queries with clear intent to find one specific result and the corresponding specific result the user is looking for. **Highly Meets (HM)** A very helpful result for any dominant, common or reasonable minor query interpretation/user intent. **Moderately Meets (MM)** A helpful result for any dominant, common or reasonable minor query interpretation/user intent. **Slightly Meets (SM)** A less helpful result for a dominant, common or reasonable minor interpretation/user intent OR a helpful result for an unlikely minor query interpretation/user intent. **Fails to Meet (FailsM)** A result that completely fails to meet the needs of all or almost all users. For example, the result may be off-topic for the query or address a no chance interpretation of the query.

#### 13.1 Rating Result Blocks: Block Content and Landing Pages

## For Needs Met rating, you will assign a rating to each result. Each result includes the content inside the result block and landing pages associated with the result. Which part of the result do you rate? If a rating task specifically asks you to rate the Landing Page Needs Met or the Block Content Needs Met of each result, then you should follow the guidance in Section 13.1.1. Unless these specific versions of Needs Met ratings are requested, you should follow the guidance below: **Type of Block What to Rate** **Special Content Result Block** **(SCRB)** Note: Assume that interactive result blocks function as intended. Try to interact with the result block as some links, buttons, or other features in your rating task may work. The content inside this type of block should always play a large role in your rating. Some Special Content Result Blocks may have links to landing pages. In these cases, think about whether a user would click on the link in order to satisfy their user need. ● If most users would not click, rate the Special Content Result Block based on the block content alone. ● If some or many users would click, you may consider the helpfulness of the landing page(s) in addition to the content in the block. In this case, *both* need to be helpful to justify a high rating. **Web Search Result Block** A click is required, and you should evaluate the landing page to assign a rating.

## For example, think about the query \[what does love mean\]. **Result Block Query: \[what does love mean\] Rating** **Special Content Result Block** Most users would probably not click on the Special Content Result Block, because the block contains a large amount of helpful content and has no obvious landing page link associated with it. Therefore, base your rating on the content inside the block itself. **Web Search Result Block** In this case, users would have to click on the web search result in order to get an answer to the question. Therefore, base your rating on the content of the landing page.

## Here are some examples of Special Content Result Blocks where the block should be rated primarily on the content inside the block itself. As always, please use your judgment. **Query and Special Content Result Block** **Query** : \[utopia animal hospital\] **Query** : \[chicago weather\] **Query:** \[calories in a banana\] **Query** : \[how to find security code on visa\] **Query** : \[how did Lincoln die\] **Query** : \[movies san francisco\] Note: The guidance in this section specifically applies to Needs Met ratings. For Special Content Result Blocks that have landing pages, you may or may not also be asked to provide PQ ratings. In these cases, your PQ rating should always be based on the landing page. Please refer to Section 14.0 for more about the relationship between Needs Met and Page Quality ratings.

##### 13.1.1 Landing Page Needs Met Ratings and Block Content Needs Met Ratings

## In most cases, you should follow the instructions above when assigning Needs Met ratings. In some cases, though, a rating task may include special instructions that ask you to assign **Landing Page Needs Met** or **Block Content Needs** **Met** ratings. In these cases, follow the instructions below: **Type of Needs Met Rating What to Rate** **Landing Page Needs Met** Landing Page Needs Met ratings should be based **exclusively** on the landing page(s) links in the result block. This applies to both SCRBs and Web Search Result Blocks. The content that appears inside the result block should **not** factor into Landing Page Needs Met ratings. **Block Content Needs Met** Block Content Needs Met ratings should be based **exclusively** on the content inside the result block. This applies to both SCRBs and Web Search Result Blocks. Do **not** click through to any landing pages when rating Block Content Needs Met; landing page content should **not** factor into Block Content Needs Met ratings. ● For Web Search Result Blocks, only consider the extent to which the page title, snippet, and any visual content within the block would directly address user need. ● For SCRBs, only consider the extent to which the content within the block would directly address user need. **Needs Met** Follow the instructions in Section 13.1 for standard Needs Met ratings.

#### 13.2 Fully Meets (FullyM)

## **Fully Meets** is a special rating category which only applies when all of the following are true: ● The query interpretation and user intent is specific, clear, and unambiguous. ● There is a specific website, a specific webpage, a specific know-simple fact or other specific result that all or almost all users in the rating locale and user location are looking for. ● All or almost all users in the rating locale and user location would be completely satisfied by the result. Most queries cannot have a Fully Meets result. Most queries do not specify a single website or webpage. Most queries are not specific enough to have a single, know-simple fact as a comprehensive answer. For most queries, different people may want different types of results. For many queries, a single user may need to see many different results. You will need to use your judgment to decide whether a result block can **Fully Meet** the user's needs. Here are some scenarios when the **Fully Meets** rating is appropriate: ● The user is clearly looking for a specific webpage or website and the result block with the specific webpage or website **Fully Meets** the user’s need. ● All or almost all users in the rating locale or user location who search for this query would be looking for the same, specific fact or piece of information. The result block provides the information thoroughly, accurately, and clearly, and is from a trustworthy source acceptable for all or almost all users. Before using the **Fully Meets** rating for queries seeking a very specific fact or piece of information, you must check for accuracy and confirm that the information is supported by expert consensus where such consensus exists. Be conservative when using the **Fully Meets** rating. Even queries that seem to have a single right "answer" may benefit from more perspectives to satisfy all or almost all users. When in doubt, use a lower rating. Note: If a result block is very close to being fully satisfying, but the block alone may not be sufficient in order to fully satisfy all or almost all users, a rating of **Highly Meets** or **Highly Meets+** may be appropriate.

##### 13.2.1 Examples of Fully Meets (FullyM) Result Blocks

You can verify that the phone number is correct by checking Chef Chu's official website.

## **Query and User Intent Result Rating Fully Meets Explanation** **Query:** \[how to find Mac OS version\] **User Intent:** Find out how to locate the OS version of a Mac. The result block displays the complete and correct answer prominently in the result block, in a way that is easy for users to read. The result block **Fully** **Meets** the user need. **Query** : \[new york city population 2012\] **User Intent:** Find the population of New York City back in 2012\.

The result block displays the complete and correct answer prominently in the result block, in a way that is easy for users to read. The result block **Fully** **Meets** the user need.

## **Query and User Intent Result Rating Fully Meets Explanation** **Query:** \[chevron at shoreline and middlefield\] **User Location:** Mountain View, California **User Intent:** Find the specific gas station specified by the user in order to visit the location in person. The intent is to visit the specific gas station specified by the user. This result block is for the specified Chevron location, with information to visit this location in person. **Query:** \[1600 pennsylvania ave washington dc\] **User Location:** Bakersville, California **User Intent:** Find a map, directions, information about what is located at this address, etc. This block contains a map with the queried address, link to get directions, and specifies the landmark at the well-known address on the map (“The White House”). It’s not unusual to search for an address (or business) that is far from the user location. Here, the user has explicitly asked for a specific address in a far away place, and this result is very satisfying. For a query this specific, the user location does not change the rating. **Note:** A range is included because some users would be fully satisfied with this result, while some users would want more information (e.g., photos, a brief description). **User Location:** \[how tall was julia child\] **User Intent:** Find the height of American chef and author Julia Child. The result block displays the complete and correct fact in a way that is easy for users to read. The result block **Fully** **Meets** the user need.

##### 13.2.2 Examples of Queries that Cannot Have Fully Meets Results

## There are some queries that *cannot* have a **Fully Meets** result. Here are some examples. **Type of Query Example No Fully Meets Result: Explanation** Broad queries where no single result could fully satisfy all users \[knitting\] This is a broad informational query. Knitting is an activity anyone can do and that anyone can create a website for. Different users may want different types of content: videos, instructions, patterns, etc. There is no one official source for knitting information and no one result could satisfy most users. Therefore, no **Fully Meets** result is possible for this query. Famous names e.g., \[barack obama\] This is a broad informational query and it is impossible to know exactly what the user is looking for. Ambiguous queries without a clear user intent or dominant interpretation \[ada\] There is no dominant interpretation for this query. The following entities are all common interpretations: Americans with Disabilities Act, American Dental Association, and American Diabetes Association. While each interpretation has an official homepage, none is **Fully Meets** since there is no dominant interpretation. Non-famous people names e.g., \[sam wen\] Queries for people’s names can be tricky. Many or most people queries do not have a dominant interpretation. Even unusual sounding name queries may not have a dominant interpretation. For example, the queries \[sam wen\], \[tran nguyen\], and \[david mease\] can have no **Fully Meets** result because there are multiple people with each of these names, and it is not clear that most users are looking for any one particular individual.

#### 13.3 Highly Meets (HM)

## A rating of **Highly Meets** is assigned to very helpful results for any dominant, common, or reasonable minor interpretation or user intent of the query. **Highly Meets** results are highly satisfying and a good “fit” for reasonable interpretations and intents. In addition, they often have some of the following characteristics (depending on the query): ● Entertaining or enjoyable for queries with a reasonable entertainment intent ● Representative of the opinions, perspectives and experience of real people for queries with no single right answer ● For informational queries, very helpful results that, for example: ○ Are easy to understand the content, e.g., helpful images or videos, an easy to understand summary ○ Provide in-depth or insightful content, e.g., a deep dive explanation, an expert analysis ● For queries that benefit from recently created content, fresh results that provide up-to-date content on “what everyone is talking about right now” e.g., breaking news on a topic or the latest viral video or a hot new fashion trend **Highly Meets** results may be any type of content: articles, short form or long form video, images, social media posts, forum discussions, etc. There is no length requirement for **Highly Meets** results. Sometimes what makes a result satisfying is that it is short and easy to understand. Other results may be very satisfying because of the depth and richness of content. For some queries, comprehensiveness may be critically important, such as queries about truly complex topics or YMYL queries for which a short answer could be misleading. Accuracy is required for **Highly Meets** informational results. **Highly Meets** information pages on YMYL topics must be accurate and trustworthy. **Highly Meets** medical and scientific information pages must represent well-established scientific/medical consensus unless the user is clearly seeking an alternative viewpoint. A query can have many **Highly Meets** results. Search engines should strive to provide a diverse set of **Highly Meets** results from a variety of websites in a variety of content types from a variety of people and perspectives. This is especially important for queries with no single, "right answer", subjective queries, queries with multiple intents and interpretations, queries seeking opinions and perspectives, and queries simply looking to browse or explore the web. For most queries, **Highly Meets** is the highest possible rating a result can receive. Results rated **Highly Meets** represent the most helpful content available for a given query interpretation and user intent. Some queries have several **Highly** **Meets** results because there is a variety of very helpful content available on the internet that addresses reasonable query interpretations and user intents. Other queries may have no **Highly Meets** results at all because very helpful content doesn't exist on the internet or search engines are unable to find it. The standard for **Highly Meets** is very high.

##### 13.3.1 Examples of Highly Meets (HM) Result Blocks

## Query and User Intent Result Rating Highly Meets Explanation

## Query: \[trader joes\]

## 

## **Query and User Intent Result Rating Highly Meets Explanation** **Query:** \[trader joes\] **User Location:** Charlotte, North Carolina **User Intent:** There are two possible user intents: most users probably want to visit a nearby location or go to the website. This is the official website for Trader Joe’s, which has information on the businesses’ stores, promotions, recipes, news, etc. **Note:** This result block is not Fully Meets because users who want information to visit the store have to do a bit of work to find that information—it is not immediately available. **Query:** \[museum of modern art\] **User Location:** Manhattan, New York **User Intent:** There are two possible user intents: most users probably want to visit the museum (note that the user is located in NYC where the museum is located) or go to the website.

The result block shows information about the museum, and is especially helpful for users who want to visit the museum. **Note:** This result block is not Fully Meets— even though there is a website link, it is not very satisfying for users who want to go to the website because it is not as informative as a web search result block with a title, snippet, and URL.

## **Query and User Intent Result Rating Highly Meets Explanation** **Query:** \[belmont library\] **User Location:** Belmont, Massachusetts **User Intent:** Find information about this library or go to the website. There is only one library in the **user location (Belmont,** **Massachusetts)**. The result block shows information about the library, and is especially helpful for users who want to visit the location. **Note:** This result block is not Fully Meets— even though there is a website link, it is not very satisfying for users who want to go to the website because it is not as informative as a web search result block with a title, snippet, and URL. **Query:** \[belmont library\] **User Location:** Belmont, California **User Intent:** Find information about this library or go to the website. There is only one library in the **user location (Belmont,** **California)**. The result block shows information about the library, and is especially helpful for users who want to visit the location. **Note:** This result block is not Fully Meets— even though there is a website link, it is not very satisfying for users who want to go to the website because it is not as informative as a web search result block with a title, snippet, and URL. **Query** : \[celine dion\] **User Intent:** Learn more about the singer Celine Dion. The user intent is too broad to have a Fully Meets result. However, this is Celine Dion's official website and has a lot of content including recent news, show information, music, photos, videos, etc. This is a very helpful result. **Query:** \[manresa reviews\] **User Location:** San Jose, California **User Intent:** Find reviews for this restaurant located in Los Gatos, California. The LP for this web result has 127 reviews for the restaurant. The first three reviews show automatically, and then you can click to see more. This is a very helpful result.

The intent is to find coffee shops near the specific user location, represented by the blue dot on the map. This result block has a very satisfying list of nearby, popular, and prominent options within a few miles of the specific location. This kind of block is especially helpful for users who want to visit the business in person. Note that these blocks are interactive—clicking on a coffee shop will give options to call the business, get directions, read reviews, etc. **Note** : This result is not Fully Meets— even though this a very helpful result block for users seeking nearby coffee shops, it is unlikely that every user would be fully satisfied with this specific list given the abundance of coffee shops near the user location. **Query:** \[what country is mount fuji in\] **User Intent:** Find the country in which Mount Fuji is located. This is a specific **Know Simple** query. The LP for this web result provides the answer to the query along with a lot of information about the mountain.

Seeing images of trestle bridges is very helpful in understanding this type of bridge. In this case, “a picture is worth a thousand words”, meaning that a picture may be more helpful than a text description due to the unique design of the bridge.

## **Query and User Intent Result Rating Highly Meets Explanation** **Query:** \[invasive species\] **User Intent:** Find more information about invasive species. The result block has a good summary of what invasive species are. Though additional information like examples, impact, etc. would be helpful, overall this is a very helpful result. **Query:** \[verbena\] **User Location:** Austin, TX **User Intent:** Find information about the spice or the restaurant in Austin. For users in Austin, TX, the query \[verbena\] could have two different interpretations: a popular restaurant named Verbena or the plant verbena. Because the user is located in Austin, many users are probably looking for the restaurant. However, it is not completely clear because some users may want to find information about the plant. This result about the restaurant has satisfying information for users who want to visit it—the result **Highly Meets** the most likely user need. **Query:** \[kristen wiig\] **User Intent:** Find more information about the actress, comedian, writer, and producer.

#### 13.4 Moderately Meets (MM)

## A rating of **Moderately Meets** is assigned to helpful results for any reasonable interpretation or user intent of the query, including reasonable minor interpretations and intents. **Moderately Meets** results have fewer valuable attributes than **Highly Meets** results. **Moderately Meets** results should still “fit” the query, but they are less satisfying than Highly Meets results. For example: ● Moderately Meets results may be less representative of the opinions, perspectives and experience of real people for queries with no single right answer ● For informational queries, Moderately Meets results might have content that is slightly harder to understand than Highly Meets results ● Moderately Meets results may be a slightly out of date for queries that benefit from recently created content A query can have many **Moderately Meets** results. Moderately Meets results exist in all formats (video, audio, text, image) and on many types of websites: professional websites, corporate websites, forums, social media, etc. **Moderately Meets** is an acceptable rating if you see aspects of the result that are **Highly Meets** but other aspects seem **Slightly Meets**. There is nothing "wrong" with **Moderately Meets** results. **Moderately Meets** results are not out-of-date or inaccurate. **Moderately Meets** results are generally average to good.

##### 13.4.1 Examples of Moderately Meets (MM) Result Blocks

## Query and User Intent Result Rating

## User intent: Find

## information, photos, or

## This is a helpful result for the

## However, the result is not very

## satisfying or very helpful for this

## query. Moderately Meets is

## Query: \[where is virginia

## in the us\]

## User Intent: Find where

## the state of Virginia is

## located in the U.S.

## This is a helpful result for the

## reasonable interpretation and

## intent to know what states border

## Virginia. However, the result is

## not very helpful as it lacks visual

## information (e.g., map).

## Moderately Meets is

## appropriate.

## 

## **Query and User Intent Result Rating** **Moderately Meets** **Explanation** **Query:** \[kristen wiig\] **User Intent:** Find more information about the actress, comedian, writer, and producer. This is a helpful result as it is Kristen Wiig’s official website. However, the result is not very helpful because there is little content and has not been updated in years. **Moderately** **Meets** is appropriate. **Query:** \[how much does a camel cost\] **User Location** : Las Vegas, Nevada **User Intent:** Find information about the typical cost of a camel, most likely closest to the user location. The user might be interested in many things, such as the initial purchase cost of a camel, around the world, or for their location, or the ongoing cost for caring for a camel. The information in the result is helpful as a starting point but the overview does not fully address what a user in Las Vegas might be interested in.

#### 13.5 Slightly Meets (SM)

## A rating of **Slightly Meets** is assigned to results that are less helpful for a reasonable query interpretation or user intent. A rating of **Slightly Meets** is also assigned to a helpful result for an unlikely query interpretation or intent. **Slightly Meets** can also be an appropriate rating for a result which is related to the user’s information need without fully addressing it, as long as it provides some value to the user. However, if the user is looking for a specific piece of information, a result which does not provide that information, or a result which misses a key aspect of the query, cannot be rated **Slightly Meets** and should be rated **Fails to Meet**. Slightly Meets results may have some aspect that prevents a higher rating, for example they may have outdated information. A query can have many **Slightly Meets** results. **Slightly Meets** results exist in all formats (video, audio, text, image) and on many types of websites: professional websites, corporate websites, forums, social media, etc. Often there is nothing "wrong" with **Slightly Meets** results \- they may simply be a less helpful "fit" for the particular query in the rating task. A **Slightly Meets** result for one query may be a **Highly Meets** result for a different query. **Important:** Many users decide which result to click or tap on based on the content in the result block, such as the title of the web result on the search results page. (Note that these titles usually come from webpages.) A result with a very misleading or exaggerated title should be rated **Slightly Meets** or lower, due to the poor user experience that occurs when the landing page does not match the expectation of the user when clicking or tapping on the result.

##### 13.5.1 Examples of Slightly Meets (SM) Result Blocks

## Query and User Intent Result Rating Slightly Meets Explanation

## Query: \[britney spears\]

## User Intent: Find

## information about Britney

## Spears (e.g., current

## news, pictures).

## The LP of this web result has a

## 2006 article about Britney Spears

## filing for divorce. This is very old,

## stale news, making this result

## less helpful for users.

## Query: \[honda odyssey\]

## User Intent: We will

## assume that users are

## interested in the current

## Honda Odyssey model,

## unless specified otherwise.

## Although the LP has

## comprehensive information from

## a reputable source, the

## information is about the 2010

## Honda Odyssey. This

## information would be considered

## stale for the query today, making

## this result less helpful for users.

## Query: \[hot dog\]

## User Intent: Find

## information about hot

## dogs, such as recipes or

## nutrition information.

## The LP of this web result is about

## the movie “Hot Dog,” an obscure

## film which came out in 1984\.

## Even though the landing page

## has good content, this is an

## unlikely minor interpretation of

## this query.

## Query: \[what type of

## sharks live in rivers\]

## User Intent: Find

## information about what

## types of sharks live in

## rivers.

## This result block does not

## contain enough information to be

## fully satisfying and mentions only

## one type of shark. This is not a

## very helpful result.

## 

## **Query and User Intent Result Rating Slightly Meets Explanation** **Query:** \[ibm\] **User Intent:** Go to the IBM website or find information about the company. This block contains images of the logo for IBM. These images are not a very helpful result for an unlikely minor intent of the query. **Query:** \[chase\] **User Intent:** Most users are looking for the official Chase bank website or a nearby branch. Some users may be interested in information about the bank. **User Location** : Kansas City, MO Most users in this locale are looking for the official Chase bank website. Very few people are looking for a definition of this common word. This is not a helpful result for most people. **Query:** \[bears swimming\] **User intent:** Find images, videos or information about bears swimming. Most users are looking for information about real bears, or images/videos of real bears swimming. This page sells a novelty t-shirt with an image of a bear swimming in a human athletic competition, which not many users would be looking for. **Query** : \[allergy symptoms\] **User intent** : Find information about allergy symptoms. This news article (current as of fall 2024\) discusses falling leaves as an allergy trigger. The article does list some common seasonal allergy symptoms. However, this is not a medical resource, and it does not cover allergy symptoms for common issues such as food allergies, etc. Given that this may be a YMYL topic, a medical resource would be more helpful. There are many different types of allergies and many different allergy symptoms. This is a very specific article about falling leaves and has some allergy symptom information, but likely few people would find it very helpful.

## **Query and User Intent Result Rating Slightly Meets Explanation** **Query:** \[djokovic fastest serve speed\] **User Intent:** Find information about Novak Djokovic's fastest recorded tennis serve speed. The user is interested in an objective, single, specific fact and the result doesn't directly provide this. It includes some related information, including an approximate partial response (‘over 200 km/h’). **Query:** \[monmouth il which county\] **User Intent:** Find out the county for Monmouth, Illinois. This Landing Page provides a trustworthy, accurate answer, but it is presented incidentally and indirectly, requiring the reader to infer the fact: “Monmouth College was opened, which to some is considered “Warren County’s greatest asset”, “Monmouth truly is a great asset to Warren County and the United States. “

#### 13.6 Fails to Meet (FailsM)

## A rating of **Fails to Meet** should be assigned to results that fails to meet the needs of all or almost all users. **Fails to Meet** results have some aspect that causes them to be unhelpful for the query, such as a lack of attention to an aspect of the query (or user location) that is critical for satisfying the user intent. **Fails to Meet** may also be used for results that have incorrect or very outdated information. **Fails to Meet** results may be helpful for a no chance interpretation. **Fails to Meet** results may be off-topic for any query interpretation. Search results should never surprise people with unpleasant, upsetting, offensive, or disturbing content. For this reason, all of the following types of content should be rated **Fails to Meet** if it is clear that the user is not looking for such content: ● Harmful to Self or Other Individuals ( Section 4.2 ) ● Harmful to Specified Groups ( Section 4.3 ) ● Harmfully Misleading Information ( Section 4.4 ) ● Untrustworthy ( Section 4.5 ) ● Spammy ( Section 4.6 ) ● Porn ( Section 15.1 )

##### 13.6.1 Examples of Fails to Meet (FailsM) Result Blocks

## Query and User Intent Result Rating Fails to Meet Explanation

## Query: \[can penguins

## climb\]

## User Intent : Find

## information about whether

## Penguins are able to climb

## or not.

## The result is about climbing a

## rock formation called The

## Penguins in the Arches National

## Park. This result is off-topic and

## does not answer the likely user

## intent of whether penguins can

## climb or not.

## Query: \[mike\]

## User Location: Eustis,

## Florida

## User Intent: Find

## information about

## something related to Mike.

## Note: For this query, it is

## unlikely users want to go

## anywhere in person.

## This is a broad query and it is

## unclear exactly what the user is

## looking for.

## This result block shows

## visit-in-person information for two

## businesses that contain the

## name Mike. However, the query

## is very broad and it is very

## unlikely these businesses are

## what users seek given the query.

## Query: \[united 656\]

## User Intent: Find

## information about flight

## 656 operated by United

## Airlines (e.g., whether the

## flight is on time, what gate

## it is departing from).

## This result shows information for

## a church, an event venue, and

## the closest airport. However,

## users clearly want to know

## details about a specific flight, and

## there is absolutely no information

## in the block about the flight. This

## result Fails to Meet the needs of

## the user.

## 

## **Query and User Intent Result Rating Fails to Meet Explanation** **Query:** \[german cars\] **User Intent:** Find information about German cars or go to the official homepage of a German automaker. This LP is the homepage of Subaru, a Japanese car company, not a German car company. This result completely **Fails to** **Meet** the needs of the user. **Query:** \[company to get rid of the possum in my attic\] **User Location:** Naperville, Illinois **User Intent:** Find a company to trap and remove a possum from the attic. This LP is the homepage of a pest control company in Australia. U.S. users would need a U.S. company to take care of this problem. There is a mismatch between the page and the locale that makes this result helpful for no users—it completely **Fails to Meet** the needs of the user. **Query:** \[starting jets quarterback 2001\] **User Intent:** Find the name of the starting quarterback for the New York Jets football team in

2001. ## 

## Although this is a trustworthy website for information about NFL football, this LP does not contain the information requested by the user. This result **Fails to Meet** the needs of the user. **Query:** \[doctor salary\] **User Location** : San Francisco, California **User Intent:** Find information about doctor salaries. The answer in this block is about the cost of education, not salary, which is misleading and doesn’t answer the user’s query. **Query:** \[who invented stairs\] **User Intent:** Find out about the origin of stairs. The answer provided in this result block is factually inaccurate. Stairs have been a common architectural feature of buildings, pathways, outdoor structures, etc. since long before 1948, and they were not invented by a person named Werner Bösendörfer.

## **Query and User Intent Result Rating Fails to Meet Explanation** **Query:** \[batman\] **User Location:** Anaheim, California **User Intent:** Find information about the fictional superhero that appears in American comic books, movies, and television shows. It is extremely unlikely (potentially a no chance interpretation) that this query is looking for information on a city in Turkey called Batman, given that the user is located in the United States. This result **Fails** **to Meet** the needs of the user. **Query:** \[non-dairy options at Marianne's Ice Cream vs The Penny Ice Creamery\] **User Location:** Santa Cruz, California **User Intent:** Compare the non-dairy options between two different ice cream shops. The user wants to know about the non-dairy options at both of the named ice cream stores, most likely to compare which store has more appealing options. This response only mentions a single non-dairy option (vegan dark-chocolate sorbet) at one of the stores, which does not satisfy the user intent to compare the specific options available at each of the stores. **Query:** \[how long is oppenheimer movie\] **User Intent:** Find information about the runtime of the 2023 film *Oppenheimer*. While the Landing Page technically contains an answer, the context around the answer does not give the user confidence that the answer is correct. The answer is presented in a quote by an actor in the film who is expressing some uncertainty around the length of the film ("I think it's almost three hours.”).

## **Query and User Intent Result Rating Fails to Meet Explanation** **Query:** \[weather paris, texas\] **User Location:** Paris, Texas **User Intent:** Find current weather information for Paris, Texas. This result completely fails to satisfy the user intent, which is to find weather information for Paris, Texas, and *not* Paris, France. **Query:** \[go kart for sale\] **User Location:** Warrington, Pennsylvania **User Intent:** Find go karts for sale in the Warrington, Pennsylvania area. This result block shows a go kart arcade in Warrington, Pennsylvania, and two other go kart arcades in the surrounding area. These arcades are places to go ride go karts, not purchase them, so the result completely **Fails to Meet** the user intent. **Query:** \[ralphs\] **User Location:** San Clemente, California **User Intent:** There are two possible user intents: most users probably want to visit a nearby Ralphs location or go to the website. Ralphs is a nationwide supermarket chain. These locations are all in San Diego, California, which is a major city south of the user location (about 60 miles away). These results are too far to be helpful.

## **Query and User Intent Result Rating Fails to Meet Explanation** **Query:** \[amazon\] **User Location:** Austin, Texas **User Intent:** Go to the Amazon website. Users issuing this query want to go to the Amazon website. Showing information about how to visit or call the corporate office for an online company would not be helpful. At the time this example was written, the Amazon corporate office was not open to the public; very, very few people ever go to an Amazon corporate office. If someone needed to go to the office for an interview or business visit, they would need to get that information from someone at the company or would use a more specific query. **Query:** \[what is the closest large city\] **User Location:** Myrtle Beach, South Carolina **User Intent:** Find the closest large city to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. A news result is completely unhelpful for this query. This result **Fails to Meet** the needs of the user. **Query:** \[australian open mens singles result 2008\] **User Intent:** Find a page that displays the 2008 men’s singles result for this tennis tournament. This LP is about the 2004 Australian Open, not the 2008 Australian Open. It does not pay attention to an aspect of the query that is important for satisfying user intent (i.e., 2008). The result **Fails to Meet** the user intent. **Query:** \[tooth loss five years old\] **User Intent:** Find information about tooth loss in a five-year-old child. This LP has information about tooth loss in pike fish and has the words “five years old” on the page. This result **Fails to Meet** the user intent because it has keyword matches only and is unhelpful for the query. **Query:** \[what is wedding in spanish\] **User Intent:** Find how to say the word “wedding” in Spanish. The translation in the result block is completely wrong and inaccurate. Mañana means “tomorrow,” not “wedding.”

## **Query and User Intent Result Rating Fails to Meet Explanation** **Query:** \[american express\] **User Intent:** Go to the American Express card website or get information about the company and its products and services. The LP is a humorous blog post about a wife helping her husband to buy a suit. The page mentions “American Express,” but is insufficiently related to the query to be helpful for users, so it **Fails** **to Meet** the user intent. Note: Even if this blog post were more recent, it would still fail to meet the user intent. **Query:** \[how to quit smoking\] **User Intent:** Find information on ways to quit smoking. This LP has gibberish text. Read this sentence: “How do you make a cigarette symbol on the keyboard? In.” This result is unhelpful for the query. **Query:** \[air canada phone number\] **User Intent:** Find the customer service phone number for the airline Air Canada. Remember that you should check for the factual accuracy of answers. For this result, go to the company’s page at [http://www.aircanada.com/en/customer](http://www.aircanada.com/en/customer) care/int/ and select USA to check the number shown here. According to the airline’s website, the correct phone number is 1-888-247-2262. Because this answer is incorrect, it should be rated **Fails to Meet**. **Query:** \[miley cyrus\] **User Intent:** Find information about the American singer/actress Miley Cyrus, such as biographical info, discography/filmography, current news, etc. Miley Cyrus was alive at the time this example was written. This LP is an article written by an unknown author that was designed to look like a news story and falsely states that she died. The article has not been updated, clarified, or removed even days after having been proven false. This result is useless so it should be rated **Fails to Meet**. Remember: Just because a website has the look and feel of a traditional news site does NOT mean that you should consider the reporting to be factually accurate without further research. Watch out for sites that present themselves as news, but were actually created with the intent to mislead or misinform users.

## **Query and User Intent Result Rating Fails to Meet Explanation** **Query:** \[who is hitler's daughter\] **User Intent:** Find the name of or information about Adolf Hitler's daughter, if Hitler in fact had a daughter. This LP is a blog post presenting a factually unsupported conspiracy theory that Angela Merkel is the daughter of Adolph Hitler. Because the MC is inaccurate and misleading, it completely **Fails to Meet** the user intent, even though the topic of the page matches the query. Note: A more helpful result for this query might confirm that Adolf Hitler had no children, or provide information on the novel *Hitler's Daughter* by Jackie French.

### 14.0 The Relationship between Page Quality and Needs Met

## The Needs Met rating is based on *both* the query and the result. You must carefully think about the query and user intent when assigning a Needs Met rating. The Page Quality rating slider does *not* depend on the query. Do not think about the query when assigning a Page Quality rating to the LP. Some results don’t have a Page Quality slider. If a result block has no Page Quality rating slider, you do not have to give a Page Quality rating. If there is a Page Quality slider, please assign a Page Quality rating based on the landing page. Here is some guidance about assigning Needs Met and Page Quality ratings: ● Useless results should always be rated **FailsM** , even if the landing page has a high Page Quality rating. Useless is useless. ● The **HM** rating is not appropriate if a page is untrustworthy or has any other undesirable characteristics, such as outdated or inaccurate information. There are very high standards for the **HM** rating. ● A page can have such low Page Quality that it is unhelpful or even harmful, such as gibberish pages or scams. These types of extremely low quality pages should be rated **FailsM** because the Page Quality issues interfere with helpfulness. (An exception is queries with clear website intent, where the target website should be rated **FullyM**. People are allowed to search for any website and search engines should honor that intent when it is clear.)

## **Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating Explanation** **Query:** \[symptoms of dehydration\] **User Intent:** Find information about the symptoms of dehydration. **Needs Met** : Even though the article is topical, the information is not trustworthy and is potentially misleading or harmful. This result is unhelpful for the query. **Page Quality** : This is a YMYL topic. This page has no evidence of medical expertise/authority and is not trustworthy. **Needs Met** : This is a very helpful result for the query. **Page Quality** : This is a YMYL topic. This page is on a highly authoritative medical website and has a lot of reliable and accurate MC. This page is very trustworthy. **Query:** \[how many octaves on a guitar\] **User Intent:** Find out the number of octaves on a guitar. **Needs Met** : This block shows the number of octaves on a piano, not a guitar. Even though this block has a link to a high quality landing page about pianos, the information shown in the block is inaccurate with respect to the query. This result **Fails to Meet** the user need. **Page Quality** : There is a lot of helpful MC on the landing page. The page has medium to high E-E-A-T. **Medium+** to **High** is an appropriate rating.

### 15.0 Rating Porn, Foreign Language, and Did Not Load Results

## You will be asked to assign **Porn** , **Foreign Language** , and **Did Not Load** flags to result blocks when appropriate. Some rating tasks may also ask you to identify **Upsetting-Offensive** and/or **Not-for-Everyone** results. All flags should be assigned based on the result alone and do not depend on the query. Here is a screenshot of the flags: Click on the flag name to select it. The flag will turn red and change the “No” to “Yes.” For example, here is a result block that shows when the **Foreign Language** flag should be used. **Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Flag Explanation** **Query:** \[baidu.com\] **Locale:** English (US) **User Intent:** Go to the Baidu website. This LP is the homepage of the Baidu website. The result is the target page of the query, but is in a foreign language (Chinese). This result merits a **FullyM** rating and the **Foreign Language** flag.

#### 15.1 Porn Flag

## Please assign the **Porn** flag to all porn pages, whether the query is porn-seeking or not. The **Porn** flag does not depend on the query or user intent. This flag should be used if the content inside the result block, or the content on the LP, is pornographic, including porn images, links, text, pop-ups, and/or prominent porn ads. An image may be considered porn in one culture or country, but not another. Please use your judgment and knowledge of your locale. **Remember** : The **Porn** flag is used to indicate that the result is porn. It doesn’t matter whether the query “asks for porn”.

#### 15.2 Needs Met Rating for Porn Results

##### 15.2.1 Needs Met Rating for Clear Non-Porn Intent Queries

## If the user intent is clearly **not** porn-seeking, a landing page that has porn for its MC should be rated **Fails to Meet**. ● When the user intent is clearly not porn, a porn result should be considered unhelpful or useless. ● Uninvited porn is a very bad experience for many users. The following queries should be considered non-porn intent queries: \[girls\], \[wives\], \[mature women\], \[gay people\], \[people kissing\], \[boy speedos\], \[moms and sons\], \[pictures of girls\], \[pictures of women\], \[mothers and daughters\], \[cheerleaders\], etc.

## Remember to assign the **Porn** flag for all porn pages. Use your judgment and represent users in your locale**.** **Query User Intent Landing Page Rating Porn Flag?** \[toys\], English (US) Find toys to buy. Example Warning – this page is porn.^ **FailsM**^^ Yes^ \[how tall is a camel\], English (US) Find the answer to this question about camels.^ Example Warning – this page is porn.^ **FailsM** Yes \[car pictures\], English (US) Find pictures of cars. Example Warning – this page is porn.^ **FailsM** Yes

##### 15.2.2 Needs Met Rating for Possible Porn Intent Queries

## Some queries have both non-porn and porn interpretations. For example, the following English (US) queries have both a non-porn and an erotic or porn interpretation: \[breast\], \[sex\]. We will call these queries “possible porn intent” queries. For "possible porn intent" queries, please rate as if the non-porn interpretation were dominant, even though some or many users may be looking for porn. For example, please rate the English (US) query \[breast\] assuming a dominant health or anatomy information intent. **Query User Intent Landing Page Rating Porn flag?** \[breasts\], English (US) Find anatomy or health information about breasts.^ Example **HM** No \[breasts\], English (US) Find anatomy or health information about breasts.^ Example Warning – this page is porn.^ **FailsM** Yes

##### 15.2.3 Needs Met Rating for Clear Porn Intent Queries

## For very clear porn intent queries, assign a rating to the porn landing page based on how helpful it is for the user. Even though there is porn intent, the page should still be assigned a **Porn** flag. Do not simply rate all porn pages for porn queries as **MM** or **HM**. Even though the query is porn and the result is porn, the page must fit the query and be helpful to get a high Needs Met rating. Pages that provide a poor user experience, such as pages that try to download malicious software, should also receive low ratings, even if they have some images appropriate for the query. **Query User Intent Landing Page Rating Porn Flag?** \[freeones\], English (US) Navigate to the Freeones homepage. Example: [http://www.freeones.com](http://www.freeones.com/) Warning – this page is porn. **FullyM** Yes \[freeones\], English (US) Navigate to the Freeones^ homepage. Example: [http://www.baberoad.com](http://www.baberoad.com/) Warning – this page is porn. **FailsM** Yes \[anime sex pictures\], English (US) Find anime sex pictures. Example Warning – this page is porn.^ **MM** to **HM** Yes \[cheerleader porn\], English (US) Find porn pictures of cheerleaders. Example Warning – this page is porn.^ **MM** to **HM** Yes

#### 15.3 Reporting Illegal Images

## **Child Pornography** **Note:** When working on rating projects in any task location or locale, you must follow United States federal law, which considers child pornography to be illegal. **Definition of Child Pornography** An image is child pornography if it is a visual depiction of someone who appears to be a minor (i.e., under 18 years old) engaged in sexually explicit conduct (e.g., vaginal or anal intercourse, oral sex, bestiality or masturbation as well as lascivious depictions of the genitals), or sadistic or masochistic abuse. The image of sexually explicit conduct can involve a real child; a computer-generated, morphed, composite or otherwise altered image that appears to be a child (think of images that have been altered using “Photoshop”); or an adult who appears to be a child; and the image can be non-photographic (e.g., drawings, cartoons, anime, paintings, or sculptures) so long as the subject is engaging in sexually explicit conduct that is obscene. If it is indistinguishable from child pornography, it is child pornography. Even if the pornographic image depicts children in a literary (think of the famous book "Lolita"), political (think of political cartoons), artistic, or scientific context, please send the link to your employer/company as instructed below. Depiction of the genitals does not require the genitals to be uncovered. Thus, for example, a video of underage teenage girls dancing erotically, with multiple close-up shots of their covered genitals, or images of children with opaque underwear that focus on the genitalia could be considered child pornography. An image of a naked child (e.g., in the bathtub or at a nudist colony) is not considered child pornography as long as the child is not engaging in sexually explicit conduct, or the focus is not on the child’s genitalia. Visual depictions of adults who look like children (e.g., a 35-year-old man play-acting in diapers, or an obvious woman dressed as a school girl) are not child pornography. If you don't think it's a minor, it probably isn’t child pornography. However, if you cannot tell that the person in the image is over 18 (e.g., an under-developed 18-year-old whose body hair has been waxed), that is child pornography. **Reporting Instructions** Please report images containing child pornography (URLs only) as instructed by your employer/company.

#### 15.4 Foreign Language Flag

##### 15.4.1 Using the Foreign Language Flag

## Please do not assign the **Foreign Language** flag when the language on the landing page is one of the following: ● The task language ● A language that is commonly used by a significant percentage of the population in the task location ● English For example, most Catalan-speaking users in Spain also speak Spanish. Therefore, for rating tasks in Catalan (ES), the Foreign Language flag should NOT be assigned to landing pages in Catalan, Spanish, or English.

## Here is a screenshot of a result block that shows when the **Foreign Language** flag would be used. **Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Flag Explanation** **Query:** \[baidu\] **Locale:** English (US) **User Intent:** Go to the Baidu website. This LP is the homepage of the Baidu website. The result is the target page of the query, but is in a foreign language (Chinese). This result merits a **FullyM** rating and the **Foreign Language** flag. **Important** : ● Please assign the **Foreign Language** flag even if you personally understand the language, but most users in your locale do not. ● Please assign the **Foreign Language** flag based on the language of the landing page, not the appearance of the result block. ● Please remember to flag all foreign pages with the **Foreign Language** flag, even if most users in your locale would expect or want a foreign language page for the query. ● Sometimes it is difficult to determine what language the landing page is in. The LP may have multiple languages or no words at all. In these cases, try to represent users in your locale. Does it feel like a foreign language page? When in doubt, don’t use the **Foreign Language** flag.

##### 15.4.2 Needs Met Rating for Foreign Language Results

## You must assign a Needs Met rating for all result blocks in your task, even if the result blocks have a foreign language landing page. In most cases, pages you flag as **Foreign Language** should be rated **FailsM** , because they cannot be understood by most users in your locale and are therefore useless. Remember that if users in your locale can read the language, then you shouldn’t be using the **Foreign Language** flag. Occasionally, you will encounter helpful **Foreign Language** pages. If the query clearly indicates that most users would expect or want a foreign language result, then the Needs Met rating of the foreign language page should *not* be **FailsM**. For example, please assign the **FullyM** rating and **Foreign Language** flag for baidu.com if the query is \[baidu.com\], English (US). Videos are often an example where foreign language pages are helpful and desired. Think about user intent and what pages are good for users. If the query “asks” for a foreign language song, band, film, sporting event, etc., then a video of the song, band, film, sporting event, etc. is helpful since it can probably be understood or enjoyed even though it is in a foreign language. For these types of queries, foreign language results are often expected. If the video is someone talking about the song, band, film, or event, the result probably cannot be understood or enjoyed and should be assigned a **FailsM** rating and the **Foreign Language** flag. Note: If you are unable to evaluate the Page Quality rating of a **Foreign Language** result, you do not need to assign a Page Quality rating and can leave the slider at **N/A**.

## **Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation** **Query:** \[video of celine dion singing s’il suffisait d’aimer\] **Locale:** English (US) **User Intent:** Watch a video of Celine Dion singing this song. This video is just what English (US) users are looking for, even though the video is not in English. The language of the LP is mostly English (even though the video is in French), so the **Foreign Language** flag is not needed. **Query:** \[kasal, kasali, kasalo\] **Locale:** English (US) **User Intent:** Watch a trailer of this Filipino film or find information about it. The query is for “Kasal, Kasali, Kasalo,” a Filipino film. The LP is a clip from the movie in Filipino (Tagalog), the language spoken in the Philippines. It would be helpful for many English (US) users who type the query, even though it is not in English. Use your judgment when deciding whether to assign the **Foreign** **Language** flag.

#### 15.5 Did Not Load Flag

##### 15.5.1 Using the Did Not Load Flag

## **Did Not Load** is used to indicate technical problems with the webpage that prevent users from viewing any LP content. Use the **Did Not Load** flag when: ● The MC of the landing page is a web server or web application error message and there is no other content on the page: no navigation links, no home link, no SC, and no Ads. See here for a Wikipedia page on different types of error messages. ● The landing page is completely blank: no MC, no SC, and no Ads. Assign the **Did Not Load** flag based on the landing page, not the result block. Here is an example of a **Did Not Load** landing page. You cannot tell that the landing page doesn’t load by looking at the result block. **Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Flag Explanation** **Query:** \[douglas instruments\] **User Intent:** Navigate to the homepage of this website. This page displays a generic 404 message. There is no MC, SC, or Ads on the page. This result merits a **FailsM** rating and the **Did Not Load** flag. Here are screenshots of other types of landing pages that should be assigned the **Did Not Load** flag: DNL1 , DNL2. You should **not** use the **Did Not Load** flag for: ● Malware warnings, such as “Warning – visiting this site may harm your computer\!” ( example ). ● Pages that have removed or expired MC (e.g., expired classified listing, removed social media post, products or services unavailable). ● Pages that are inaccessible because you need a subscription to view the MC.

##### 15.5.2 Needs Met Rating and the Did Not Load Flag

## All result blocks must be given a Needs Met rating. If the landing page truly doesn’t load, assign the **Did Not Load** flag and rate the page **FailsM**. True **Did Not Load** pages are useless. Sometimes the page partially loads or has an error message. Give Needs Met ratings based on how helpful the result is for the query. Error messages can be customized by the website owner and are part of a well-functioning website. Sometimes these pages are helpful for the query. Note: If you are unable to evaluate the Page Quality rating of a **Did Not Load** result, you do not need to assign a Page Quality rating and can leave the slider at **N/A**.

## **Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality**^ **Rating, Flags** **Explanation** **Query:** \[boys pink snow shoes\] **User Intent:** Find information about or purchase boys’ snow shoes. **Needs Met** : The MC has an error message, but the LP has a lot of SC. However, the page has no information about boys pink snow shoes and is unhelpful for the query. **Page Quality** : This LP is on a well-known, reputable merchant website. Despite the error message, this page does a nice job of explaining the issue and providing a search box, including helpful search tips and customer service information. Do not assign the **Did Not Load** flag. **Query:** \[bible passages\] **User Intent:** Find specific passages in the Bible. **Needs Met** : In spite of the customized “No results found” message on the LP, it has links to all passages in the Bible, organized by book. This is a very helpful result. **Page Quality** : This page is a well-known, reputable reference website. In addition to links to all passages in the Bible, this error page provides a search box as well as a suggestion explaining how to refine searches. Do not assign the **Did Not Load** flag. **Query:** \[broadway tickets\] **User Intent:** This is a **Know** query or **Do** query. The user wants to search prices and/or purchase tickets to a Broadway show in New York City. Clicking on this result block leads to a malware warning. You can assume that the page is malicious without continuing to the page. As discussed in Sections 4.5.5 and 13.6, you should assign a **FailsM** Needs Met rating and **Lowest** Page Quality rating. Do not assign the **Did Not Load** flag. **Query:** \[paranormal activity\] **User Intent:** Learn more about the 2007 film *Paranormal Activity* or the associated film series. This page cannot be reached because the site's server IP address was not found. There is no MC, SC, or Ads on the page. This result merits a **FailsM** Needs Met rating, and no Page Quality rating is required. Assign the **Did Not Load** flag.

#### 15.6 Additional Flags in Some Rating Tasks

## Some rating tasks may ask you to identify **Upsetting-Offensive** and/or **Not-for-Everyone** results. Mark content that may be upsetting or offensive from the perspective of a typical user in your locale as **Upsetting-Offensive** , keeping in mind that people of all ages, genders, races, religions, and political affiliations use the Internet to understand the world and other points of views. Mark content that may be unpleasant or uncomfortable for some people in your locale (e.g., content that may not be appropriate in a public space, professional environment, or school) as **Not-for-Everyone**.

### 16.0 Many Types of Helpful Results

## Some queries may have many different possible meanings, or people may be looking for different things. Make sure to give Highly Meets ratings to very helpful results for all reasonable interpretations and intents, including reasonable minor interpretations. ● Many queries have different possible meanings or interpretations. Don't assume – do query research\! Results for a diverse set of reasonable interpretations may be very helpful. ● For any given query interpretation, different users may have different intents. For example, different people who search for \[avatar\] with the movie in mind could be seeking different kinds of information about the movie. Some may be seeking reviews, others could want to see what people are saying on social media, while others still could be interested in the cast or ways to watch the movie, etc. Results that satisfy different reasonable intents may be very helpful to different users. ● It’s also possible for a single user to have many different intents for any given query interpretation. That is, one person searching \[avatar\] could be broadly interested in the movie, and that person might want to browse reviews and social media posts, see the cast, and find out how to watch the movie. A diverse set of results that satisfy different reasonable intents may be very helpful to individual users, too\! Results of different types may be helpful for many kinds of queries, including queries with a single, clear interpretation or intent. Consider what kinds of results are helpful for all queries you rate, including: ● Different formats (e.g., text, video, image, audio) ● Different experiences, perspectives and opinions (e.g., a personal blog or a social media post) ● Different content depths (e.g., the 10 second summary video and the 1 hour deep dive documentary) ● Different types of sites: corporate, not for profit, government, social media, forums, personal blogs, etc. ● ... and many more\! Make sure all types of very helpful results get a Highly Meets rating. Some queries may benefit from a wide variety of helpful results: ● Queries that seek experiences, opinions and perspectives, such as \[should i get a dog\], \[what does love feel like\] ● Queries that are subjective, such as \[best music to run to\] ● Exploration and browsing queries – users may need to see many different options, such as \[ideas for bathroom remodel\], \[black suit\], \[inexpensive engagement rings\] ● Queries with no single, right answer, such as \[how to ask your boss for a raise\]

#### 16.1 Rating Queries with Both Website and Visit-in-Person Intent

## Some queries have two possible strong intents:

1. ## **Go to the website** intent: in order to, for example, find out information, buy something online, make a reservation,    schedule an appointment, interact with customer support, or fulfill some other need that can be satisfied online

2. ## **Visit-in-person** intent: user wants to visit the store, business, etc. in person    For these queries, result blocks that only satisfy one intent should NOT get a **Fully Meets** rating.

## **Query and User Intent Result Block and LP Needs Met Rating and Explanation** **Query:** \[target\] **User Location:** Jacksonville, Florida **User Intent:** There are two possible strong user intents: most users probably want to visit a nearby Target location or go to the website to shop online, research products, find prices, etc. The result block shows three popular Target locations in Jacksonville, with information that is especially helpful for users who want to visit the store. This fulfills the user intent to find a nearby Target location. The result is very satisfying and fulfills the user intent to shop online or otherwise use the website. **Query:** \[dmv\] **User Location:** Belmont, California **User Intent:** There are two possible strong user intents: most users probably want to visit a nearby DMV location or go to the DMV website to renew a license, pay a fee, find some information, etc. The result block shows two nearby DMV locations, with information that is especially helpful for users who want to visit the locations. This fulfills the user intent to find a nearby DMV location. The result is very satisfying and fulfills the user intent to find information or otherwise use the website (e.g., to review a license, pay a fee).

### 17.0 Specificity of Queries and Landing Pages

## Some queries are very general and some queries are specific. Here are some examples that compare levels of specificity of English (US) queries: **Query More Specific Query Even More Specific Query** \[chair\] \[dining room chair\] \[ikea “henriksdal” highback upholstered chair\] \[library\] \[harvard library\] \[harvard anthropology library\] \[interview questions\] \[interview questions for teachers\] \[practice interview questions used for teach for america\] \[restaurants\] \[chinese restaurants\] \[takeout chinese restaurants in downtown Austin\] \[coffee shops\] \[starbucks\] \[red rock coffee mountain view\] Results for specific queries are easier to rate on the Needs Met scale because we know more about what the user is looking for. Giving a Needs Met rating for results for general queries can be difficult. As always, your rating is based on how helpful the result is for the query, not the specificity fit. When the query is a broad category, such as \[cafes\] \[restaurants\] \[hotels\] \[books\] \[tourist attractions in paris\] etc., popular and prominent examples may be considered very helpful. Please do web research to help you understand what is popular and prominent in different locations.

## **Query and User Intent Result Block & LP, Needs Met & Page Quality Ratings Explanation** **Query:** \[credit cards\] **User Intent:** Users are probably looking to sign up for a credit card online, or want to research credit cards before signing up. Even though there are many options, a page for an individual company that offers different cards could be very helpful. **Needs Met** : This LP is more specific than the query, but could still be a very helpful result because Visa is a popular credit card company. **Page Quality** : Visa is a credit card company with high E-E-A-T that offers services for credit cards, banking, etc. and has a good reputation. **High+** to **Highest** is an appropriate rating. Even though there are many options, a page for an individual company that offers different cards could be very helpful. **Needs Met** : This LP is more specific than the query, but could still be a very helpful result because Discover is a popular credit card company. **Page Quality** : Discover is a company with high E-E-A-T that offers services for credit cards, banking, etc. with a good reputation. **High+** to **Highest** is an appropriate rating. This page offers a list of top credit cards in a variety of categories. **Needs Met** : This LP fits the query. It would be helpful for most users. **Page Quality** : This website helps consumers make money decisions. It has a good reputation, high E-E-A-T, and has been recommended by several major newspapers. **High** is an appropriate rating. This page describes a credit card that requires union membership. **Needs Met** : Since the credit card requires union membership, this result is an unlikely minor interpretation for the broad query about credit cards. **Page Quality** : This company is an expert on its own credit card, which is issued by HSBC Bank, a financial services organization with a good reputation and high E-E-A-T. **High** is an appropriate rating.

## **Query and User Intent Result Block & LP, Needs Met & Page Quality Ratings Explanation** **Query:** \[hotels\] **User Intent:** Users are probably planning a trip, but this query is very general and vague. This is a popular travel aggregator website, and the hotel page on the site can help users find hotels in the U.S. Users can read reviews, compare hotels, or make a reservation. **Needs Met** : This LP fits the query. This is a very helpful result. **Page Quality** : Orbitz is a popular website with high E-E-A-T and a good reputation. **High** is an appropriate rating. This is a very popular hotel chain with hotels available in the majority of the U.S. at many different price points. Even though the list of possible hotel chains is long, the homepage of an individual chain that offers different prices, features, and location options could be very helpful. **Needs Met** : This LP is more specific than the query, but could still be a very helpful result because the Marriott is a popular chain of hotels. **Page Quality** : The Marriott website gives information on Marriott hotels, a popular chain of hotels. Marriott has a good reputation and is an expert on Marriott hotels, making the information on this page highly authoritative. **High+** to **Highest** is an appropriate rating. This is the webpage of the Marriott Courtyard hotel in Emeryville, California. **Needs Met** : The LP is too specific for the query, but this is a well-known brand and users can navigate to other Marriott hotels from this page. This is a less helpful result. **Page Quality** : The Marriott website gives information on Marriott hotels, a popular chain of hotels. Marriott has a good reputation and is an expert on Marriott hotels, making the information on this page highly authoritative. **High+** to **Highest** is an appropriate rating.

## **Query and User Intent Result Block & LP, Needs Met & Page Quality Ratings Explanation** **Query:** \[target\] **User Location:** Jacksonville, Florida **User Intent:** Go to target.com or find a nearby Target store. **Needs Met** : The result block shows three popular Target locations in Jacksonville, with information that is especially helpful for users who want to visit the store. No Page Quality rating required The LP is the Target website. **Needs Met** : The result is very satisfying for users that want to go to the website. **Page Quality** : Target is a popular shopping website in the U.S. with high E-E-A-T and is trusted by users for online purchases. **High** to **High+** is an appropriate rating. The LP is the “store locator” page on the Target website. **Needs Met** : Even though the LP is more specific than the query, this result would be very helpful for users who issued this query with the intent to find Target locations to visit in person. **Page Quality** : Target is the expert about where its stores are located. This page is the most authoritative page on this topic. **High+** to **Highest** is an appropriate rating. **Query:** \[target\] **User Location:** Jacksonville, Florida **User Intent:** Go to target.com or find a nearby Target store. The LP on the Target website is for a specific type of women’s pants. **Needs Met** : The LP is much more specific than the query and is an unlikely to no chance interpretation of the query. **Page Quality** : Target is a popular shopping website in the U.S. with high E-E-A-T and is trusted by users for online purchases. **High** to **High+** is an appropriate rating.

### 18.0 Needs Met Rating and Freshness

## Some queries demand very recent or “fresh” information. Users may be looking for “breaking news,” such as an important event or natural disaster happening right now. Here are different types of queries demanding current/recent results. **Type of Query Example Queries Explanation** “Breaking news” queries \[tornado\], \[tsunami\] Assume users need the information right away. Imagine someone who needs immediate weather information because a big storm is coming. Information about last year's weather would not be helpful. Recurring event queries, such as elections, sports events, TV shows, conferences, etc. \[olympics\], \[american idol\], \[redsox schedule\], \[tax forms\], \[elections\] Assume users are looking for the most recent or current information about the event. For example, if the Olympics are happening right now, users searching \[olympics\] want information about the current Olympics, not results from years ago. If the next Olympics are a few months away, users are probably interested in the upcoming Olympics. Current information queries \[population of paris\], \[amount of u.s. debt\], \[airfare from ny to sfo\], \[next federal holiday\] Assume users are looking for the most current information, such as prices or airfare. Product queries \[iphone\], \[toyota camry\], \[windows^ operating system\] Assume users are looking for information about the most recent model/version for these product queries. When a query demands recent content, only pages with current, recent, or updated content should get high Needs Met ratings. For these queries, pages about past events, old product models and prices, outdated information, etc. are not helpful. They should be considered “stale” and given low Needs Met ratings. In some cases, stale results are useless and should be rated **FailsM**. For some queries, there may be “newsy” or recent information user intent, as well as more “timeless” information user intent. Users issuing queries for celebrities or politicians may be interested in biographical information, or users may be looking for the latest news or gossip. Freshness is generally less of a concern for Page Quality rating. “Stale” pages can have high Page Quality ratings. For example, some highly reputable news websites maintain “archival” content. However, unmaintained/abandoned “old” websites or unmaintained and inaccurate/misleading content is a reason for a low Page Quality rating. **Note** : The date the page was created may be different from when the content was last updated or modified. When content is updated, the page will sometimes show the date of the update, not the date the page was created. Some websites always show the current date, regardless of when the content was last updated. If you are curious about the content of a page, see here to try the “Wayback Machine” on the Internet Archive. Not all pages are available, but this tool may help you understand how some pages were created and how their content has changed over time.

## **Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating Explanation** **Query:** \[los angeles traffic\] **User Location:** Los Angeles, California **User Intent:** Users are looking for **current** information about traffic conditions in Los Angeles. Even pages about traffic conditions the day before would be considered stale for the query. This LP shows traffic conditions in Los Angeles on August 7, 2012, which is the day this example was written. This LP shows traffic conditions in Los Angeles on August 6, 2012\. It is stale and useless for the query even though it is only one day old. **Query:** \[nobel peace prize winner\] **User Intent:** Find the name of the most recent winner of this prize. This is a **Know Simple** query. At the time this example was originally written, 2011 was the most recent year that the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded. This LP on the New York Times website has information about the most recent winner of this prize, based on the date when this example was written. This LP on the BBC website has information about the 2006 winner of this prize. The 2006 winners of the prize may is an extremely minor interpretation of the query, so this page is stale for the query.

## Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating Explanation

## Query: \[arthritis\]

## User Intent : Users are

## looking for information

## about this disease.

## Because there is

## ongoing research done

## on treatments and cures

## for most diseases, users

## are probably looking for

## authoritative, up-to-date

## information on arthritis.

## Medline Plus is an authoritative

## website that regularly updates its

## content.

## This 2006 article is extremely

## stale for this medical query. For

## this type of query, old medical

## potentially dangerous.

## Query: \[when was

## User Intent: Users want

## understood fact.

## This LP has the information users

## are looking for. This query does

## not require fresh results.

## We couldn’t find a stale page for this query. N/A

## 

### 19.0 Misspelled and Mistyped Queries and Results

#### 19.1 Misspelled and Mistyped Queries

## You will notice that some queries are misspelled or mistyped. Here are some examples of queries that are obviously misspelled: **Misspelled Query Query Interpretation** \[federal expres\], English (US) The only reasonable query interpretation is the company named Federal Express. \[new england patroits\], English US) The only reasonable interpretation is the NFL football team. \[byonce knowles\], English (US) The only reasonable interpretation is the famous singer/actress, Beyonce Knowles. Some misspelled or mistyped queries are more difficult to interpret. Use your judgment and do query research. For **obviously** misspelled or mistyped queries, you should base your rating on user intent, not necessarily on exactly how the query has been spelled or typed by the user. For queries that are **not** obviously misspelled or mistyped, you should **respect the query as written,** and assume users are looking for results for the query as it is spelled.

#### 19.2 Name Queries

## Consider the query \[john stuart\], English (US). There is a very famous Jon Stewart, the comedian and former host of a popular U.S. television show. However, we should not assume that the query \[john stuart\] has been misspelled. There are many people named John Stuart. We will respect the query as written and assume the user is looking for someone named “John Stuart.” **Query and Possible** **User Intents Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating**^ **Explanation**^ **Query:** \[mich ea l jordan\], English (US) **User Intent:** There are many people named “Micheal Jordan.” Helpful results for more prominent people named Micheal Jordan should receive higher ratings than helpful results for less prominent people named Micheal Jordan. Because Michael Jordan is such a famous athlete/celebrity, we will consider Michael Jordan to be an unlikely minor interpretation. The page lists all members of the LinkedIn site named “Micheal Jordan.” LinkedIn is a very popular social networking website for professionals in the U.S. This result would be very helpful for users trying to find information about someone named “Micheal Jordan.” This is a somewhat helpful result for an unlikely minor interpretation of the query.

### 20.0 Non-Fully Meets Results for URL Queries

## Raters sometimes ask the question, “For a well-formed working URL query, are the only acceptable Needs Met ratings for a result either **Fully Meets** or **Fails to Meet** ?” The answer is no. There can be other helpful results for URL queries. Finding information about a website is a reasonable interpretation and intent for URL queries, as some users issue URL queries to find information about a website, such as reviews or recent news. We recommended this to you as one method of reputation research in the PQ guidelines. Real users do this too. Results that give reviews and reputation information can be very helpful for a URL query. However, websites that offer usage statistics about a website are not usually helpful results for URL queries. Most users aren’t interested in this kind of information.

## **Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating Explanation** **Query:** \[potterybarn.com\] **User Intent:** Pottery Barn is a home furnishing store. Users may want to go to the website, do research, or find more information on the company. This LP is the target of the query. Online coupon codes are very popular in the U.S. and this LP (from a well-known coupon site) displays codes for online purchases on the Pottery Barn website. Users may be interested in coupon codes and this would be very helpful for those shopping online at potterybarn.com, especially frequent shoppers. This LP (from a well-known review site) has reviews of the potterybarn.com website. Users may be interested in reading reviews when considering whether to make purchases at potterybarn.com, especially new shoppers. **Query:** \[ratemyprofessors.com\] **User Intent:** Go to [http://www.ratemyprofessors.c](http://www.ratemyprofessors.c/) om , a website where students can rate their college professors. This LP is the target of the query. This LP is an extensive encyclopedia article for the queried URL. It contains many helpful sections, including information detailing the rating process, comparison with in-class evaluations, criticism, etc. This is a very helpful result for a reasonable interpretation of the query.

### 21.0 Product Queries: Importance of Browsing and Researching

## Some product queries, such as \[ipad reviews\], have a clear information-seeking ( **Know** ) intent. Other product queries, such as \[buy ipad\], have a clear purchase ( **Do** ) intent. And some product queries, such as \[ipad store.apple.com\], have a clear navigation ( **Website** ) intent. However, most product queries don’t obviously specify one type of intent. Keep in mind that many users enjoy browsing and visually exploring products online, similar to window shopping in real life. Give high Needs Met ratings to results that allow users to research, browse, and decide what to purchase. Users may not always plan to buy products online that they are browsing and researching, for example, cars or major appliances. Even though the ultimate goal may be to purchase a product, many other activities may take place first: researching the product (reviews, technical specifications), understanding the options that are available (brands, models, pricing), viewing and considering various options (browsing), etc. **Important** : Page Quality ratings for product results need extra care and attention. **Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating Explanation** **Query:** \[high definition tv\] **User Intent:** This query doesn’t specify a size or brand of TV. Users are probably doing research before making a purchase. This LP has comprehensive information about different types of high definition TVs (plasma, LCD, LED), as well as reviews about many specific models. The website is known for having helpful reviews and information about electronics. **Query:** \[girl toddler jeans size 3T\] **User Intent:** The query is very specific. The user wants to browse and find an item to buy. This is a helpful page for browsing and shopping for toddler girls jeans. There are many options for jeans in size 3T. This is a high quality store known for selling jeans. **Query:** \[cufflinks\] **User Intent:** Most users probably want to find different cufflink styles and options to browse or purchase. This LP has a large collection of cufflinks from a very reputable retailer. There are many options and styles. This is a good page for browsing. There are helpful features at the top to choose styles, price ranges, etc.

## Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation

## Query: \[twist of fate ring pandora\]

## User Intent: The user is looking

## for a specific ring sold by the

## Pandora brand and likely wants to

## research the ring, see what it

## looks like, find options to browse

## or purchase, etc.

## This result has a variety of

## images of the ring, showing

## different angles and materials.

## Knowing what the ring looks like

## is very helpful to users who are

## researching the product and

## browsing options that are

## available.

## 

### 22.0 Rating Visit-in-Person Intent Queries

## When there is a user location for a visit-in-person intent query and a location has not been specified in the query itself, such as \[chinese restaurants\] with a user location of **Boston, MA** , results in or near the user location are the most helpful. How close is “near”? The type of business and/or entity should be taken into consideration when deciding if the distance of the visit-in-person result is too far. For example, most people are not willing to travel very far for a gas station, coffee shop, supermarket, etc. Those are types of businesses that most users expect to find nearby. However, users might be willing to travel a little farther for certain kinds of visit-in-person results: doctors’ offices, libraries, specific types of restaurants, public facilities like swimming pools, hiking trails in open spaces, etc. Sometimes users may accept results that are even farther away, such as a very specialized medical clinic. In other words, when we say users are looking for results “nearby,” the word “nearby” can mean different distances for different queries. As always, please use your judgment.

#### 22.1 Examples Where User Location Does (and Does Not) Matter

## As previously mentioned, the user location may not always change our understanding of the query and user intent. Below is one example where user location plays an important role, and two examples where user location does not matter. **Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation** **Query:** \[minimum wage rate\] **User Location:** Wichita, Kansas **User Intent:** Find out what the current minimum wage is. Different states in the U.S. have different minimum wage rates. Users might be interested in the minimum wage in their state and how it compares to other places. This result block displays the complete and correct answer prominently in the result block, in a way that is easy for users on mobile devices to read. **Note** : Assume that the result shows current information for users at the time this example was written. If you were rating this task, you would need to verify that the minimum wage rate in this result block is accurate for the state of Kansas. This is the official Kansas state website page on minimum wage for Kansas. This LP has the minimum wage rates for all states. It is on the official U.S. Department of Labor website. Though it takes some work to find the information specific to Kansas, this is a very helpful result for users seeking general information about the minimum wage rate. This is the official California state website page on minimum wage for California. Given the user location, this is an unhelpful result.

## **Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation** **Query:** \[amazon jobs\] **User Location:** Miami, Florida **User Intent:** Users are looking for job opportunities at Amazon. The user is looking for a job at Amazon and there is no information in this result block that will help the user explore job opportunities—it **Fails to Meet** the user need. This is Amazon’s official page on careers and jobs at Amazon, where users can search for currently open opportunities. This page is exactly what the user is looking for—it **Fully Meets** the user need.

### 23.0 Rating English Language Results in Non-English Locales

## **The following rating guidance is for raters in non-English locales. You may stop reading this section if your task** **language is English, such as English (US), English (IN), English (NG), etc.** Your Needs Met ratings should reflect how helpful the result is for users in your locale. When the query is in the language of your locale, assume that users want results in that language. We know that **you** can read English (you are reading this document\!), but you should only give high Needs Met ratings to English results if users in your locale would expect or want them for a particular query. Unless requested by the query, English results should be considered useless if most users in the locale can't read them. However, rating can be more difficult when the query includes English names, words, etc., or when it's unclear whether English results would be satisfying for a particular query. Please use your judgment and knowledge of your locale to determine the appropriate rating. **Important:** Please keep in mind that every locale will have unique considerations regarding the number and variety of languages (such as official languages, regional languages, local dialects, etc.), writing systems, and keyboard input languages commonly in use. While these guidelines may not include examples for your locale, it is important that you represent users in your task location and culture in order to interpret the query and rate results. When in doubt, please assume that users would prefer results in the task language unless the query clearly indicates otherwise.

#### 23.1 Examples of English (and Non-English) Results in Non-English Locales

## The section includes some examples using Hindi (IN) and Korean (KR) as the locales. In both cases, we cannot assume that users in these locales—i.e., Hindi-speaking users in India, or Korean-speaking users in Korea—are able to read English. Unless most users in the locale would be satisfied by English results for the query, we will consider them unhelpful or even useless ( **FailsM** ). **Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation** **Query:** \[ राजा रव वमा \] **Locale:** Hindi (IN) **User Intent:** The user wants to find information about राजा रव वमा, an Indian artist. This Hindi language Wikipedia page on राजा रव वमा is very helpful for Hindi (IN) users. This English Wikipedia page about राजा रव वमा has similar content to the Hindi Wikipedia page. Although there are some helpful images on the page, few Hindi users would be able to read this page. **Query:** \[ 버락 오바마 \] **Locale:** Korean (KR) **User Intent:** 버락 오바마 is Barack Obama in Korean, so the user wants to find information about Barack Obama. This Korean language Wikipedia page on Barack Obama is very helpful for Korean (KR) users. This English Wikipedia page about Barack Obama has similar content to the Korean Wikipedia page. Although there are some helpful images on the page, very few Korean users would be able to read this page.

## Here are two examples where the query includes proper nouns typed in Latin script, such as famous people, places, titles of books or films, etc. For these queries, users would prefer to see results in the language of their locale. **Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation** **Query:** \[ ronaldo \] **Locale:** Hindi (IN) **User Intent:** The user wants to find information about Cristiano Ronaldo, a famous footballer. Although the query was typed in Latin script, most Hindi users would want to see information about this person in Hindi. This Hindi language Wikipedia page on Cristiano Ronaldo is very helpful for Hindi (IN) users. This English Wikipedia page about Cristiano Ronaldo has similar content to the Hindi Wikipedia page. Although there are some helpful images on the page, few Hindi users would be able to read this page. **Query:** \[titanic 1997\] **Locale:** Korean (KR) **User Intent:** T he user wants to purchase a DVD or find information about the movie “Titanic,” released in 1997\. Although the query was typed in Latin script, most Korean users would expect to see Korean language reviews or Korean stores for purchasing the movie. This Korean result on a Korean website is very helpful. This English language landing page has helpful content for users who can read English. Although there are some helpful images on the page, very few Korean users would be able to read this page.

## Here are two additional examples where the query was typed in Latin script (including some English words), yet users would still prefer to see results in the language of their locale. **Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation** **Query:** \[ mahila cricket sri lanka ka match\] **Locale:** Hindi (IN) **User Intent:** The user wants to find information about a women’s cricket match against Sri Lanka on February 17, 2016\. Although the query includes some English words, it is a Hindi query typed in Latin script. Most Hindi users would expect to see Hindi results, like this helpful article. This English language landing page has helpful content for users who can read English, but few Hindi (IN) users would be able to read this page. **Query:** \[samsung tablet\] **Locale:** Korean (KR) **User Intent:** The user wants to purchase, find information, or go to the Galaxy tablet page on the Samsung website. Although the query was typed in Latin script and includes some English words, most Korean users would expect to see the Korean page on the Samsung website. This Korean result is very helpful. This English language page on the website of Samsung, the company that makes this tablet, has helpful content. Although there are some helpful images on the page, very few Korean users would be able to read this page.

## On the other hand, there may be queries where the needs of most users would actually be satisfied by English language results, even if the query itself is typed in the task language. For example, for queries about global businesses and organizations, users may expect or want to visit the English language version of the business/organization's official website in some locales. Similarly, for queries seeking technical information such as manufacturer part numbers, product specs, scientific or chemical formulas, etc., the answer to the query may be typically expressed in the English language in some locales. For these queries, users may expect or want to see English results in order to satisfy their need. Please use your judgment and knowledge of your locale to determine the appropriate rating. **Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation** **Query:** \[ हावड वेबसाइट\] **Locale:** Hindi (IN) **User Intent:** हावड वेबसाइट is "Harvard website" in Hindi. Users want to go to the official website of Harvard University, which is a well-known research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This is the official website of Harvard University. Even though the query was typed in Hindi, this English website is clearly what users are looking for. Users would be fully satisfied by this result. **Query:** \[시스코 카탈리스트 스위치 IOS 복원하기\] **Locale:** Korean (KR) **User Intent:** This Korean query can be translated as "recovering IOS on Cisco Catalyst switches". The user wants to find out how to restore the IOS operating system on a Cisco Catalyst switch, which is a specific brand/model of computer networking device. This article comes from a blog that contains lots of technical information and troubleshooting tips about IT operations and programming. The landing page provides step-by-step instructions in Korean, along with the exact commands in English that users would need to type into a console in order to recover the operating system for the queried device. This tutorial would be very helpful and easy to follow for Korean users who are familiar with this type of networking device.

## Finally, in some locales, English is one of the official languages or a commonly spoken language. In these locales, English websites are easy to use and could be helpful, depending on the query. For example, the Singapore government recognizes four official languages: English, Malay, Chinese, and Tamil, but English is the first and most dominant language in Singapore. **Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation** **Query:** \[barack obama\] **Locale:** English (SG) **User Intent:** Find information about Barack Obama. This Wikipedia page in English about Obama would be very helpful to users in Singapore.

### 24.0 Rating Dictionary and Encyclopedia Results for Different Queries

## When assigning Needs Met ratings for dictionary and encyclopedia results, careful attention must be paid to the user intent. Like all results, the helpfulness of dictionary and encyclopedia results depend on the query and user intent. Dictionary and encyclopedia results may be topically relevant for many searches, but often these results are not helpful for common words that most people in your rating locale already understand. Reserve high Needs Met ratings for dictionary and encyclopedia results when the user intent for the query is likely "what is it" or "what does it mean" and the result is helpful for users seeking that type of information. **Important** : Think about how helpful it is to get dictionary or encyclopedia results for very common words. Often there may be much more likely and reasonable intents. If you think most people know the meaning of the word and it is unlikely that people would be looking for the definition, a **Slightly Meets** rating may be appropriate. **Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation** **Query:** \[ obsequious \] **User Intent:** Users are probably looking for the definition of this vocabulary word. This is a vocabulary word often studied in secondary school and found on college entrance exams. Many users may be looking for a definition and would find this dictionary result helpful.

## **Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation** **Query:** \[ rainbow \] **User Intent:** This is a broad query. Users could be looking for many things, including images of rainbows, brands or local stores/organizations with "rainbow" in their name, etc. Most users probably already know what a rainbow is and would not be looking for a definition. Even if the user needs help understanding the word, images or a simple description would be more helpful than this dictionary result. **Query:** \[ cafeteria \] **User Location:** Eugene, Oregon **User Intent:** Most English-speaking users in the US are familiar with cafeterias. Users are most likely looking for a place to eat. Most users are looking for a place to eat rather than general information about cafeterias. Even though this is an in-depth encyclopedia article that matches the topic of the query, this is not a very helpful result. **Query:** \[ history of ATM machines \] **User Intent:** Find information about the history of ATM machines (e.g., the inventor, when it was invented, its evolution, etc.). The user wants to learn more information about the history of ATM machines. This encyclopedia article includes an extensive section on ATM machine history. This is a very helpful result.

## **Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation** **Query:** \[ atm near me \] **User Location:** Livingston, Wyoming **User Intent:** Find ATMs near the user location. The user intent is to find a nearby ATM machine. This encyclopedia article fails to meet the need of the user because it has no information about nearby ATM locations.

## Appendix 1: Using the Evaluation Platform

### 25.0 Overview

## The Evaluation Platform is the system you will use to acquire and rate tasks. You can access the Evaluation Platform by going to this link: [http://www.raterhub.com/evaluation/rater](http://www.raterhub.com/evaluation/rater) As a Search Quality Rater, you will work on many different types of rating tasks. This section provides guidance on how to use certain features of the Evaluation Platform that you will encounter frequently in Page Quality (PQ) and Needs Met (NM) rating tasks. Some of these concepts may apply to other types of rating tasks as well. **Important:** Many tasks that you receive will display project \-specific instructions on the task page. You should always follow these project-specific instructions when they are provided.

### 26.0 Acquiring Tasks

## Here is a simplified screenshot of the task acquisition page on the Evaluation Platform. Please note that changes are sometimes made to the appearance of this page, so it may not look exactly as it appears below. A few notes about how to acquire tasks from this page: **● rater@gmail.com:** Make sure you are logged in to the account you used to sign up for the rating program. **● Acquire if available:** Click this button to acquire a new task. ● **Headphones or speakers required:** This label indicates that the task requires headphones or speakers (for example, to listen to an audio file). Please note you may see other types of labels next to the button on the task acquisition page. Sometimes there will be only one button, while other times you may see more than one button displayed to distinguish tasks with different requirements. When there is more than one displayed, you may choose the one you want to acquire.

### 27.0 Rating Tasks Using the Rating Interface

## Here is a general outline of the steps you should follow upon acquiring a task:

1. ## **Read the instructions:** Pay close attention to any project-specific instructions and examples if provided.

2. ## **Fill out the task:** Assign ratings to result blocks, provide comments, answer questions, etc. (as applicable).

3. ## **Check your work:** Verify that you entered your ratings as intended. Additionally, make sure that you provided a    response to all required questions.

4. ## **Submit the task:** Click the "Submit" button at the end of the page to submit the task and continue rating.    Alternatively, click "Submit and Stop Rating" to submit the task and return to the Evaluation Platform homepage.

## Additionally, here are a few general things to keep in mind when rating tasks: ● **Result blocks are sometimes slow to load:** Before assigning any ratings, please scan the task page to make sure that all result blocks have loaded. Please note that result blocks may be slow to load and/or that the task page may need reloading if there are empty result blocks. If the result blocks fail to load after refreshing a few times, please release the task by following the instructions in Section 28.0 below. ● **Sometimes a side will not have any result blocks:** If one side displays the message “This side did not generate any results,” please do not release the task. ● **Do not refresh the task page after assigning ratings:** If you refresh the page after assigning ratings, you will lose them and they will have to be entered again.

### 28.0 Releasing Tasks

## Most raters have difficulty rating some tasks now and then. Some queries are about highly technical topics (e.g., computer science or physics) or involve very specialized areas of interest (e.g., gaming or torrents). You will report problems and release tasks using the “Report a Problem / Release this Task” button in the rating interface. Here is what the “Report a Problem / Release this Task” button looks like: Clicking the red button displays a menu with several reporting and release options: Please note that changes are sometimes made to this menu, so it may not look exactly as it appears above.

## In general, you should choose whichever option best describes your reason for releasing the task. If you are unsure, please select the closest option, or contact your employer/company for further guidance. Please leave a comment explaining the release when it makes sense to provide additional information, for example, when you are releasing for a “technical problem.” Here are some examples for the "lack expertise” and “technical problem” release options. **Lack expertise:** These queries require specialized knowledge and may be difficult for some raters. **Query General Query Topic** \[cortisol secretion shows a blank pattern of secretion\] Scientific query \[minecraft gun and vehicles 1.1 mod installer\] Gaming query \[python pandas index like matrix\] Technical query **Technical problem:** These result blocks have question marks and other characters where text should be. Note: Based on the number and/or type of tasks that you release, you may be asked to provide additional details about the reason for some of the releases.

### 29.0 Understanding the User Location on the Task Page

## The location of the user should be inferred from the map provided. The map can help clarify where the user was physically located when the query was issued. On the map, the user location can be precise (blue dot), approximate (blue rectangle or circle), or missing altogether if the user location is unknown. Here are some examples of what you might see at the top of the task: A precise user location is represented by a blue dot ( ). Sometimes you will see a shaded blue circle around the blue dot. The blue dot is the user’s most likely location, but it is possible they are located anywhere within the larger shaded blue region. The user can be located anywhere within the blue rectangle on the map. The map includes a response pin, which is a marker for a visit-in-person result block in the task. If there are three visit-in-person result blocks in the task, there should be three response pins on the map.

### 30.0 Reporting Duplicate Results in Tasks

## In some rating tasks, you may be asked to determine whether any results are Duplicates (dupes). This section provides guidance and examples of how to report duplicate results In Needs Met (NM) rating tasks.

#### 30.1 Pre-Identified Duplicates

## Some duplicate results are automatically detected and will be pre-identified for you. They will be annotated by the text “ **Same as** ...” right below the slider and above the result block. This is what these pre-identified dupes look like: **Left Side Right Side** **Please note** : You cannot unselect dupes that have been automatically detected and pre-identified.

#### 30.2 Rater-Identified Duplicates

## You are also asked to help identify duplicate results that have not been automatically detected. Please mark two results as dupes if they have essentially the same content on the main landing page AND you would not want a search engine to return both results for the query. Please note that in Needs Met rating and other query-based tasks, dupe identification is **query-dependent**. ● **Specific queries** : For queries where the user is looking for a specific piece of content (such as queries looking for song lyrics, queries looking for a specific article, etc.), obtaining that piece of content from **different sites** could be helpful for users to verify the information, so they should **not** be rated as dupes. ● **Broad queries** : If the query is broad, results may be considered dupes even if they have minor content differences on the page (such as different ads, images, or related links). Please identify dupes both within the same side and across sides. Even for cross-side results, you should still ask yourself the question, “Would users want to see both results if they were returned by the same search engine?” **Note** : If two result blocks have very different types of content or very different appearances, do not mark them as duplicates even if they have the same landing page URL. For example, these two blocks should not be marked as duplicates of each other.

#### 30.3 Reporting Duplicate Results

## When you notice that the results in two or more result blocks are duplicates, please click on the **Select Dupe** link at the top of one of the results. The current result (the result you clicked on) will be highlighted in red at the top of the block. You can then check results that are duplicates of the current result, and the checked results will be highlighted in yellow. You must select the “ **Dupe of** ...” button. The duplicate results that you checked will be annotated by " **Dupe of** ..." text at the top of the block. After selecting all dupes, click on the **finish selecting dupes** link to return to the normal rating mode. The link’s name will change back to **Select Dupes** , and you will be able to report other sets of dupes, if there are any. If you change your mind, you can always uncheck a result. **Dupes** QUERY: \[choosing and installing a motorcycle battery\] URL 1: [http://www.caimag.com/wordpress/2010/03/06/motorcycle-battery-how-to-choose-install](http://www.caimag.com/wordpress/2010/03/06/motorcycle-battery-how-to-choose-install) URL 2: [http://www.articlesbase.com/motorcycles-articles/choosing-and-installing-a-motorcycle-battery-47798.html](http://www.articlesbase.com/motorcycles-articles/choosing-and-installing-a-motorcycle-battery-47798.html) **Reason** : Both of these results display the same article (which also appears on many other pages on the web). The only real difference between the landing pages are the Ads displayed around the article. The query is broad enough that users would **not** benefit by search engines returning more than one of these results. **Dupes** QUERY: \[jason castro\] URL 1: [http://www.myspace.com/jasoncastromusic](http://www.myspace.com/jasoncastromusic) URL 2: [http://www.myspace.com/jasoncastromusic?MyToken=503599bf-01cf-4427-bdf4-d63920c107f9](http://www.myspace.com/jasoncastromusic?MyToken=503599bf-01cf-4427-bdf4-d63920c107f9) **Reason** : These two results have the same landing page, even though the URLs are different. Users would **not** benefit by search engines returning both results. **Not Dupes** QUERY: \[material girl lyrics\] URL 1: [http://www.lyricsfreak.com/m/madonna/material+girl\_20086925.html](http://www.lyricsfreak.com/m/madonna/material+girl_20086925.html) URL 2: [http://www.lyrics007.com/Madonna%20Lyrics/Material%20Girl%20Lyrics.html](http://www.lyrics007.com/Madonna%20Lyrics/Material%20Girl%20Lyrics.html) **Reason** : Even though both pages display the lyrics to the song “Material Girl,” users would probably want to have the option to visit both pages so that they could verify the accuracy of the lyrics. Users could benefit by search engines returning more than one page with the lyrics to the song.

### 31.0 Simplified Needs Met Tasks

## Some Needs Met rating tasks may not require ratings for all blocks. In these blocks, the Needs Met and Page Quality rating scales will be greyed out and annotated with the text "No Rating Required". The greyed-out results (sometimes referred to as "contextual results") are shown to help you understand the query and inform your ratings. You can click on them when you feel like they will be helpful in determining your ratings. Here is an example:

## Appendix 2: Guideline Change Log

## This guideline is updated regularly to remain relevant over time. Changes from the past two years (September 2023 \- September 2025\) are summarized below. **Date Published Summary of Changes** **September 2025** ● Updated YMYL definitions ● Added additional examples for clarity ● Minor changes throughout (fixed typos, etc.) **January 2025** ● Updated Page Quality Lowest and Low sections to better align with Google Search Web Spam Policies ; added illustrative examples ● Expanded guidance on assessing minor interpretations and intents for Needs Met ratings and added illustrative examples ● Minor changes throughout (updated rating ranges, removed outdated examples; fixed typos; updated browser requirements; etc.) **February 2024** ● Updated characteristics of untrustworthy pages and added illustrative examples **November 2023** ● Simplified Needs Met scale definitions and added guidance for specific types of Needs Met ratings; refreshed rating guidance and examples accordingly ● Modernized examples by adding examples for popular platforms and video formats and removing outdated and redundant examples ● Minor changes throughout (expanded rating guidance for forum pages; updated language, examples, and explanations for consistency across sections; fixed typos; etc.)

## General Guidelines Overview

**Welcome to the Search Quality Rating Program\!**  
As a Search Quality Rater, you will work on many different types of rating projects. The General Guidelines primarily  
cover Page Quality (PQ) rating and Needs Met (NM) rating; however, the concepts are also important for many other  
types of rating tasks.  
For brevity, we refer to “Search Quality Raters” as “raters” in these guidelines.

## Introduction to Search Quality Rating

### 0.0 The Search Experience

The World Wide Web is a vast collection of online information and content. Internet search engines provide a powerful  
way to explore this online universe. There are many ways people search: people may type words into a search box in a  
browser, speak to a mobile phone or assistant device, use search engine autocomplete features, etc.  
People search the Internet for a variety of purposes, ranging from accomplishing a quick task to researching a topic in  
depth. A search may be part of a long-term project, such as a home remodel or vacation planning. A search may be  
done when someone is bored and looking for entertainment, such as a search for \[funny videos\]. A search may be a  
single question asked during a critical moment of a person's life, such as \[what are the symptoms of a heart attack?\].  
Search engines exist to help people find what they are looking for. To do that, search engines must provide a diverse set  
of helpful, high quality search results, presented in the most helpful order.  
Different types of searches need very different types of search results. Medical search results should be high quality,  
authoritative, and trustworthy. Search results for \[cute baby animal pictures\] should be adorable. Search results for a  
specific website or webpage should have that desired result at the top. Searches that have many possible meanings or  
involve many perspectives need a diverse set of results that reflect the natural diversity of meanings and points of view.  
People all over the world use search engines; therefore, diversity in search results is essential to satisfy the diversity of  
people who use search.  
Finally, search results should help people. Search results should provide authoritative and trustworthy information, not  
lead people astray with misleading content. Search results should allow people to find what they're looking for, not  
surprise people with unpleasant, upsetting, offensive, or disturbing content. Harmful, hateful, violent, or sexually explicit  
search results are only appropriate if the person phrased their search in a way that makes it clear that they are looking for  
this type of content, ***and*** there is no other reasonable interpretation of the words used in their search.

### 0.1 The Purpose of Search Quality Rating

As a Search Quality Rater, you will help evaluate search engine quality around the world. Good search engines give  
results that are helpful for people in their own specific language and locale.  
No single rating can directly impact how a particular webpage, website, or result appears in Google Search, nor can it  
cause specific webpages, websites, or results to move up or down on the search results page. Using ratings to position  
results on the search results page would not be feasible, as humans could never individually rate each page on the open  
web.  
Instead, ratings are used to measure how effectively search engines are working to deliver helpful content to people  
around the world. Ratings are also used to improve search engines by providing examples of helpful and unhelpful  
results for different searches.  
As part of your role in the search quality rating program, it is important that you are familiar with and comfortable using a  
search engine. We encourage you to be an expert in search\! For example, experiment with using operators (e.g., quotes  
or a hyphen) in your searches or try using advanced search options.

### 0.2 Raters Must Represent People in their Rating Locale

It is very important for you to represent people in the locale you evaluate. You must be very familiar with the task language  
and location in order to represent the experience of people in your locale. If you do not have the knowledge to do this,  
please inform your employer/company.  
Unless your rating task indicates otherwise, your ratings should be based on the instructions and examples given in these  
guidelines. Ratings should not be based on your personal opinions, preferences, religious beliefs, or political views.  
Always use your best judgment and represent the cultural standards of your rating locale.

### 0.3 Browser Requirements

Check with your employer/company for browser requirements. You may use helpful browser add-ons or extensions, but  
please do not use add-ons or extensions that interfere with or alter the user experience of the page.

### 0.4 Ad Blocking Extensions

Do not use add-ons or extensions that block ads for Needs Met rating or Page Quality rating. These add-ons or  
extensions may cause you to give incorrect ratings. As a rater, only use an ad blocking extension or add-on if specifically  
instructed to do so in the project-specific instructions.  
**Important** : Some browsers such as Chrome automatically block some ads. As a rater, you are required to turn off any ad  
blocker capabilities of the browser you use to view webpages for rating tasks. Check your browser settings before rating  
tasks to ensure your ratings accurately reflect how people experience the page without ad blocking settings and  
extensions. For more information about Chrome Ad Blocking, see Chrome Support Page for Ad Blocking Settings.

### 0.5 Internet Safety Information

In the course of your work, you will visit many different webpages. Some of them may harm your computer unless you are  
careful. Please do not download any executables, applications, or other potentially dangerous files, or click on any links  
that you are uncomfortable with.  
**It is strongly recommended that you have antivirus and antispyware protection on your computer. This software**  
**must be updated frequently or your computer will not be protected. There are many free and for-purchase**  
**antivirus and antispyware products available on the web**.  
See here for a Wikipedia page on antivirus software and here for a Wikipedia page on spyware.  
We suggest that you only open files with which you are comfortable. The file formats listed below are generally  
considered safe if antivirus software is in place.  
● .txt (text files)  
● .ppt or .pptx (Microsoft PowerPoint)  
● .doc or .docx (Microsoft Word)  
● .xls or .xlsx (Microsoft Excel)  
● .pdf (PDF files) (Adobe Acrobat)  
If you encounter a page with a warning message, such as “Warning-visiting this web site may harm your computer,” or if  
your antivirus software warns you about a page, you should not try to visit the page to assign a rating.

### 0.6 The Role of Examples in these Guidelines

The rating concepts in these guidelines apply to all types of content. The examples throughout these guidelines are very  
important to illustrate how the concepts defined in each section should be applied in rating tasks for different types of  
webpages and different types of content.  
Please view each example and keep the following in mind:  
● Webpages and websites change rapidly, so we use images or "snapshots" of webpages in most of our examples.  
● Because some types of content are difficult to view in "snapshot" form, a description of the webpage is provided  
for each example.  
● The information in the examples was accurate at the time it was added, but content and websites may change  
over time.  
● Some examples show pages on desktop and some show pages on mobile devices.

## Part 1: Page Quality Rating Guideline

### 1.0 Introduction to Page Quality Rating

A Page Quality (PQ) rating task consists of a URL and a grid to record your observations as you explore the landing page  
and the website associated with the URL. The goal of PQ rating is to evaluate how well the page achieves its purpose.  
Here's what you'll need to be a successful Page Quality rater:  
● Your experience using the web as an ordinary user in your rating locale.  
● In-depth knowledge of these guidelines.  
● And most importantly—practice doing PQ rating tasks\!

### 2.0 Understanding Webpages and Websites

Page Quality rating requires an in-depth understanding of websites. We'll start with the basics. Along the way, we'll share  
important information about Page Quality rating, so please read through this section even if you are a website expert\!

#### 2.1 Important Definitions

Here are some important definitions:  
A **search engine** is a tool to help people find or interact with content available on the Internet.  
In these guidelines, the word " **user** " refers to a person trying to find information or accomplish a task on the Internet.  
Users are people from many different backgrounds, whose experiences and needs may differ from your own: people of all  
ages, genders, races, religions, political affiliations, etc.  
A **webpage** is connected to the World Wide Web and can be viewed or "visited" using a web browser (e.g., Chrome), a  
browser on your phone, or a search app. In the 1990s, webpage content was mostly text and links. Today, webpage  
content includes many forms of media (such as images, videos, etc.) and functionality (such as online shopping features,  
email, calculator functionality, online games, etc.).  
A **URL** is a string of letters, numbers, and punctuation that your web browser uses to “find” and display a webpage. Page  
Quality rating doesn't require you to have in-depth understanding of the structure of URLs, i.e., you don’t need to know the  
difference between host, domain, etc. But if you are interested, see here to read more.  
A **website** or **site** is a group of World Wide Web pages usually containing hyperlinks to each other and made available  
online by an individual, company, educational institution, government, or organization. Popular websites include  
Facebook, Wikipedia, Yahoo, YouTube, etc.  
**Note** : In these guidelines, we will use the word “website” to refer to a collection of pages owned and controlled by  
a single entity (individual, business, etc.). But we will also use “website” to refer to major “independent” sections  
(or hosts) of some websites that were created to achieve separate purposes. For example, the Yahoo website is  
organized into different sections (or hosts), such as Yahoo Finance ( finance.yahoo.com ), Yahoo Mail  
( mail.yahoo.com ), Yahoo Sports ( sports.yahoo.com ), etc. Each of these has its own purpose. It’s OK to refer to  
each of these sections as a website; for example, the Yahoo Finance website and the Yahoo Sports website. You  
may also refer to pages on Yahoo Finance or Yahoo Sports as belonging to the Yahoo website.  
A **homepage** of a website is the main page of the site. It is usually the first page that users see when the site loads. For  
example, [http://www.apple.com](http://www.apple.com/) is the homepage of the Apple site, [http://www.yahoo.com](http://www.yahoo.com/) is the homepage of the Yahoo  
company site, and [http://finance.yahoo.com](http://finance.yahoo.com/) is the homepage of Yahoo Finance. You can usually find the homepage of a  
website by clicking on a “home” link or logo link on subpages of a website.  
A **website owner** is the person, company, or organization who is responsible for a website.

A **content creator** is the individual(s) or entity (business, organization, etc.) who created the content on a webpage.  
**Generative AI** is a type of machine learning (ML) model that can take what it has learned from the examples it has been  
provided to create new content, such as text, images, music, and code. Learn more here. Different tools leverage these  
models to create generative AI content. Generative AI can be a helpful tool for content creation, but like any tool, it can  
also be misused.  
**Important** *:* You must be very comfortable exploring websites, both by clicking links and modifying URLs in the address  
bar of your web browser. Become a website detective and explorer\!

#### 2.2 Understanding the Purpose of a Webpage

The purpose of a page is the reason or reasons why the page was created. Every page on the Internet is created for a  
purpose, or for multiple purposes. Most pages are created to be helpful for people, thus having a beneficial purpose.  
Some pages are created merely to make money, with little or no effort to help people. Some pages are even created to  
harm users. The first step in understanding a page is figuring out its purpose.  
Why is it important to determine the purpose of the page for PQ rating?  
● The goal of PQ rating is to determine how well a page achieves its purpose. In order to assign a rating, you must  
understand the purpose of the page and sometimes the website.  
● By understanding the purpose of the page, you'll better understand what criteria are important to consider when  
evaluating that particular page.  
● Websites and pages should be created to help people. If that is not the case, a rating of **Lowest** may be  
warranted. More on this later.  
As long as the page is created to help people, we will not consider any particular page purpose or type to be higher quality  
than another. For example, encyclopedia pages are not necessarily higher quality than humor pages.  
**Important** : There are highest quality and lowest quality webpages of all different types and purposes: shopping pages,  
news pages, forum pages, video pages, pages with error messages, PDFs, images, gossip pages, humor pages,  
homepages, and all other types of pages. The type of page does not determine the PQ rating—you have to understand  
the purpose of the page to determine the rating.  
Common helpful or beneficial page purposes include (but are not limited to):  
● To share information about a topic.  
● To share a personal experience, perspective, or feelings on a topic.  
● To share pictures, videos, or other forms of media.  
● To demonstrate a personal talent or skill.  
● To express an opinion or point of view.  
● To entertain.  
● To offer products or services.  
● To allow people to post questions for other users to answer.  
● To allow people to share files or to download software.  
● To allow people to support a charity or other cause they care about.  
Here are a few examples where it is easy to understand the purpose of the page:  
**Type of Page Purpose of the Page**  
News website homepage To inform users about recent or important events.  
Shopping page To sell or give information about the product.  
Video page To share a cute video of a cat.  
Currency converter page To calculate equivalent amounts in different currencies.

Here is an example (OmNomNomNom Page) of a helpful page where the purpose of the page is not as obvious. At first  
glance, this page may seem pointless or strange. However, it is a page from a humorous site that encourages users to  
post photos with mouths drawn on them. The purpose of the page is humor or artistic expression. This page has a  
helpful or beneficial purpose. Even though the About page on this website is not very helpful, the website explains itself  
on its FAQ page.

#### 2.3 Your Money or Your Life (YMYL) Topics

Pages on the World Wide Web are about a vast variety of topics. Some topics have a high risk of harm because content  
about these topics could significantly impact the health, financial stability, or safety of people, or the welfare or well-being  
of society. We call these topics “Your Money or Your Life” or YMYL.  
YMYL topics may significantly impact or harm one or more of the following:  
● the person who is directly viewing or using the content  
● other people who are affected by the person who viewed the content  
● groups of people or society affected by the actions of people who viewed the content  
YMYL topics can directly and significantly impact people’s health, financial stability or safety, or the welfare or well-being  
of society, because of the following reasons:  
● **The topic itself is harmful or dangerous**. For example, there is clear and present harm directly associated with  
topics related to self-harm, criminal acts, or violent extremism.  
● **The topic could cause harm if the content is not accurate and trustworthy**. For example, mild inaccuracies  
or content from less reliable sources could significantly impact someone's health, financial stability, or safety, or  
impact society, for topics like: symptoms of a heart attack, how to invest money, what to do if there is an  
earthquake, who can vote, or needed qualifications for obtaining a driver’s license.  
To determine whether a topic is YMYL, assess the following types of harm that might occur:  
● **YMYL Health or Safety** : Topics that could harm mental, physical, and emotional health, or any form of safety  
such as physical safety or safety online.  
● **YMYL Financial Security** : Topics that could damage a person's ability to support themselves and their families.  
● **YMYL Government, Civics & Society** : Topics that could negatively impact groups of people, issues of public  
interest, trust in public institutions, election and voting information, and any other informational topics about  
government, civics or society that impacts people's lives.  
● **YMYL Othe** r: Topics that could hurt people or negatively impact welfare or well-being of society.  
It's possible to imagine a hypothetical harmful page for any non-harmful topic, such as the science behind rainbows or  
shopping for pencils: for either of these topics, someone could build a page that has a malicious computer virus download.  
However, for a specific topic to be YMYL, the topic itself must potentially impact people’s health, financial stability, or  
safety, or the welfare or well-being of society.  
Many or most topics are not YMYL and do not require a high level of accuracy or trust *to prevent harm*. Because YMYL  
assessment is a spectrum, it may be helpful to think of topics as clear YMYL **,** definitely not YMYL or something in  
between. Pages on clear YMYL topics require the most scrutiny for Page Quality rating.

**Type of Topic Clear YMYL Topic May be YMYL Topic**  
**Not or Unlikely YMYL**  
**Topic**  
**Information**  
Could significant harm result  
from inaccurate information?  
**Evacuation routes for a**  
**tsunami**  
**Explanation** : Inaccurate  
information on evacuation  
routes could cause significant  
harm to people.  
**Weather forecast**  
**Explanation** : In most  
situations, slightly inaccurate  
information about the weather  
forecast will not cause harm.  
People often ask family  
members "what's the weather  
today".  
**Music award winners**  
**Explanation** : This topic is  
unlikely to cause harm.  
**Advice about an activity**  
Could significant harm result  
from poor advice?  
**When to go to the**  
**emergency room**  
**Explanation** : Bad advice on  
when to go to the emergency  
room could cause significant  
harm.  
**How often to replace a**  
**toothbrush**  
**Explanation** : This is a casual  
health topic people commonly  
discuss with friends. A slightly  
imperfect suggestion is  
unlikely to significantly impact  
health or safety.  
**How frequently to wash**  
**jeans**  
**Explanation** : This topic is  
unlikely to cause harm.  
**A personal opinion**  
What impact could this opinion  
have on other people and  
society?  
**Personal opinion about why**  
**a racial group is inferior**  
**Explanation** : Pages on this  
topic have been used to justify  
or incite violence against  
groups of people.  
**Personal opinion about why**  
**an exercise is inferior**  
**Explanation** : While there may  
be a health concern if the  
exercise is extreme or risky,  
most discussions of jogging vs  
swimming, etc. involve  
personal preference.  
**Personal opinion about why**  
**a rock band is inferior**  
**Explanation** : This topic is  
unlikely to cause harm,  
although there may be strong  
opinions involved\!  
**News about current events**  
Could this topic significantly  
impact people and society?  
For societal impact, consider  
issues such as elections and  
trust in public institutions that  
benefit society.  
**News about ongoing**  
**violence**  
**Explanation** : People need  
accurate information to stay  
safe. Society may also be  
impacted by information about  
ongoing violence, as citizens  
and governments make civic  
decisions accordingly.  
**News about a car accident**  
**Explanation** : The accident  
itself may have been harmful,  
but there is likely little risk of  
future harm from small  
inaccuracies in reporting  
about an incident.  
**News about a local high**  
**school basketball game**  
**Explanation** : This topic is  
unlikely to cause harm.  
**Sharing on social media**  
Could the social media post  
cause significant harm?  
Could it hurt individuals?  
Could it damage society if  
widely shared?  
**A tide pod challenge post**  
**Explanation** : This harmful  
social media challenge was  
responsible for deaths.  
**A hot sauce challenge**  
**Explanation** : While some  
people may experience some  
discomfort by tasting various  
hot sauces, it is unlikely that  
sharing about such challenges  
would cause significant harm.  
**A music video**  
**Explanation** : This type of  
content generally has little risk  
of harm.  
**Online commerce and**  
**product reviews**  
Consider the product. Could  
the product cause significant  
harm?  
**Purchasing prescription**  
**drugs**  
**Explanation** : Prescription  
drugs have the potential to  
cause harm and require  
purchase from licensed  
pharmacies.  
**Review of a type of car**  
**Explanation** : While cars are  
big purchases, many people  
ask friends and family about  
cars.  
**Purchasing pencils**  
**Explanation** : Pencils and  
other everyday items are  
unlikely to cause harm.

If you are having trouble deciding whether a topic is YMYL, consider the following questions:

1. Would a careful person seek out experts or highly trusted sources *to prevent harm*? Could even minor  
   inaccuracies cause harm? If yes, then the topic is likely YMYL.  
2. Is the specific topic one that most people would be content with only casually consulting their friends about? If  
   yes, the topic is likely not YMYL.  
   **Important** : For pages about clear YMYL topics, we have very high Page Quality rating standards because low quality  
   pages on such topics could potentially negatively impact a person’s health, financial stability, or safety, or the welfare or  
   well-being of society.

#### 2.4 Understanding Webpage Content

All of the content on a webpage can be classified as one of the following: Main Content (MC), Supplementary Content  
(SC), or Advertisements/Monetization (Ads). In order to understand the purpose of a webpage and do PQ rating, you will  
need to be able to distinguish among these different parts of the page.  
Webpage design can be complicated, so make sure to click around and explore the page. See what kind of content is  
behind the tabs and test out the interactive page features. Content behind the tabs may be considered part of the MC,  
SC, or Ads, depending on what the content is.

##### 2.4.1 Identifying the Main Content (MC)

Main Content is any part of the page that directly helps the page achieve its purpose. MC can be text, images, videos,  
page features (e.g., calculators, games), and it can be content created by website users, such as videos, reviews, articles,  
comments posted by users, etc. Tabs on some pages lead to even more information (e.g., customer reviews) and can  
sometimes be considered part of the MC.  
The MC also includes the title at the top of the page ( example ). Descriptive MC titles allow users to make informed  
decisions about what pages to visit. Helpful titles summarize the MC on the page.  
**Type of Page and Purpose MC Highlighted in Yellow**  
News website homepage: the purpose is to inform users about recent or important events. MC \- News Homepage  
News article page: the purpose is to communicate information about an event or news topic. MC \- News Article  
Store product page: the purpose is to sell or give information about the product.  
● Content behind the Reviews, Shipping, and Safety Information tabs are considered to be  
part of the MC.  
MC \- Shopping Page  
Currency converter page: the purpose is to calculate equivalent amounts in different currencies. MC \- Currency Converter  
Blog post page: the purpose is to share music used on a TV show. MC \- Blog Post Page  
Search engine homepage: the purpose is to allow users to enter a query and search the Internet. MC \- Search Engine Homepage  
Bank login page: the purpose is to allow users to log in to bank online. MC \- Bank Login Page

##### 2.4.2 Identifying the Supplementary Content (SC)

Supplementary Content contributes to a good user experience on the page, but does not directly help the page achieve its  
purpose. SC is an important part of the user experience. One common type of SC is navigation links that allow users to  
visit other parts of the website. In some cases, content behind tabs may be considered part of the SC.  
Sometimes the easiest way to identify SC is to look for the parts of the page that *are not* MC or Ads.  
**Type of Page and Purpose SC Highlighted in Blue**  
News article page: the purpose is to communicate information about an event or news topic. SC \- News Article  
Store product page: the purpose is to sell or give information about the product. SC \- Shopping Page  
Blog post page: the purpose is to share music used on a TV show. SC \- Blog Post Page

##### 2.4.3 Identifying Advertisements/Monetization (Ads)

Ads may contribute to a good user experience. Advertisements/Monetization (Ads) is content and/or links that are  
displayed for the purpose of monetizing (making money from) the page. The presence or absence of Ads is not by itself a  
reason for a **High** or **Low** quality rating. Without advertising and monetization, some webpages could not exist because it  
costs money to maintain a website and create high quality content.  
There are many different ways to monetize a webpage, including advertisements and affiliate programs. See here for  
more information on website monetization. Note that monetization on mobile pages may be more subtle than  
monetization on desktop pages.  
The most common type of monetization is advertisements. Ads may be labeled as "ads," "sponsored links," “sponsored  
listings,” “sponsored results,” etc. Ads may change when you reload the page, and different users may see different Ads  
on the same page.  
Website owners can choose to display Ads on their page (such as by joining an advertising network ), but they may not  
always directly control the content of the Ads. However, we will consider a website responsible for the overall quality of  
the Ads displayed.  
**Important:** For the purpose of these guidelines, we will consider monetized links of any type to be “Ads.” See here for  
different types of website monetization.  
**Type of Page and Purpose Ads Highlighted in Red**  
News article page: the purpose is to communicate information about an event or news topic. Ads \- News Article  
Blog post page: the purpose is to share music used on a TV show. Ads \- Blog Post Page  
Store product page: the purpose is to sell or give information about the product. No ads – Shopping Page

##### 2.4.4 Summary of the Parts of the Page

Let's put it all together.  
● **Main Content (MC)** is any part of the page that directly helps the page achieve its purpose. MC is (or should be\!) the  
reason the page exists. The quality of the MC plays a very large role in the Page Quality rating of a webpage.  
● **Supplementary Content (SC)** is also important. SC can help a page better achieve its purpose or it can detract from  
the overall experience.  
● Many pages have **advertisements/monetization (Ads)**. Without advertising and monetization, some webpages  
could not exist because it costs money to maintain a website and create high quality content. The presence or  
absence of Ads is not by itself a reason for a **High** or **Low** quality rating.  
On some pages, user reviews and comments may be considered MC, and on other pages they may be considered SC.  
Use your best judgment and think about the purpose of the page.

Do not worry too much about identifying every little part of the page. Think about which parts of the page are the MC.  
Next, look for the Ads. Anything left over can be considered SC.  
**Type of Page and Purpose MC, SC, & Ads Highlighted**  
News article page: the purpose is to communicate information about an event or news topic. Summary \- News Article  
Store product page: the purpose is to sell or give information about the product. Summary \- Shopping Page  
Currency converter page: the purpose is to calculate equivalent amounts in different currencies. Summary \- Currency Converter  
Blog post page: the purpose is to share music used on a TV show. Summary \- Blog Post Page  
Bank login page: the purpose is to allow users to log in to the bank online. Summary \- Bank Login Page

#### 2.5 Understanding the Website

Pages often make more sense when viewed as part of a website. Some of the criteria in Page Quality rating are based  
on understanding the website that the page belongs to.  
To understand a website, start by finding out who is responsible for the website and who created the content on the page  
(more information provided in Section 2.5.2 ). Then, look for information about the website and/or content creators on the  
website itself. Websites and content creators are usually very eager to tell you all about themselves\!  
You must also look for reputation information about the website and/or content creators. What do outside, independent  
sources say about them? When there is disagreement between what the website or content creators say about  
themselves and what reputable independent sources say, trust the independent sources.

##### 2.5.1 Finding the Homepage

The homepage of a website usually contains or has links to important information about the website. Website owners  
usually make it easy to get to the homepage from any page on the site.  
Here's how to find the homepage of a website:

1. Examine the landing page of the URL in your PQ rating task.  
2. Find and click on the link labeled with the name or logo of the website (occasionally labeled as “home” or “main”),  
   which usually appears at the top of the page.  
   Sometimes, you may be given a webpage or website that appears to have no navigation links, no homepage link, and no  
   logo or other means to find the homepage. Even some **High** or **Highest** quality pages lack a way to navigate to the  
   homepage. If you can't find a link to the homepage, modify the URL by removing everything to the right of “.com,” “.org,”  
   “.net,” “.fr,” etc. and refresh the page.  
   Occasionally, your rating task will include a URL for which there are two or more justifiable “homepage” candidates. For  
   example, you may not be sure whether the homepage of the URL https://finance.yahoo.com/calendar is  
   [http://finance.yahoo.com](http://finance.yahoo.com/) or [http://www.yahoo.com](http://www.yahoo.com/).  
   **Important** : When you have more than one homepage “candidate,” please use whichever one offers the most information  
   about the specific webpage in the rating task. Use your judgment. The goal is to understand the webpage and the  
   website(s) it is associated with, not find the one unique, correct homepage.

In the following examples, we have included the URL of the page to be evaluated in the rating task, as well as the URL of  
its associated homepage. We have also included an image that shows where to click on the landing page to navigate to  
the homepage. In the image, you will see a red box around the link or logo you would click to navigate to the homepage.  
**URL of the Task Page Homepage of the Website Where to click to get to the Homepage**  
[http://www.williams-sonoma.c](http://www.williams-sonoma.c/)  
om/products/shun-premier-7-  
piece-knife-block-set  
[http://www.williams-sonoma.com](http://www.williams-sonoma.com/)  
Williams-Sonoma Homepage  
This “WILLIAMS-SONOMA” logo shown in the  
upper center of the page is clickable and takes  
users to the homepage of the website.  
[http://hms.harvard.edu/about-](http://hms.harvard.edu/about-)  
hms/facts-figures  
[http://hms.harvard.edu](http://hms.harvard.edu/)  
In this case, we will consider the Harvard Medical  
School page at [http://hms.harvard.edu](http://hms.harvard.edu/) to be the  
homepage, rather than [http://www.harvard.edu](http://www.harvard.edu/)  
(which is the homepage of Harvard University).  
Clicking the logo at the top of  
[http://hms.harvard.edu/about-hms/facts-figures](http://hms.harvard.edu/about-hms/facts-figures)  
takes users to [http://hms.harvard.edu](http://hms.harvard.edu/) , not to  
[http://www.harvard.edu](http://www.harvard.edu/).  
Harvard Medical School Facts and Figures Page  
This “Harvard Medical School” logo in the upper  
left part of the page is clickable and takes users  
to the homepage of the Harvard Medical School  
website.

##### 2.5.2 Finding Who is Responsible for the Website and Who Created the Content on the Page

Every page belongs to a website, and it should be clear:  
● Who (what individuals, company, business, organization, government agency, etc.) is responsible for the website.  
● Who (what individuals, company, business, organization, government agency, etc.) created the content on the  
page you are evaluating. Note that for pages on websites such as forums and social media platforms, people  
may post content using an alias or username in order to avoid sharing personally identifiable information online.  
In these cases, the alias or username is an acceptable way to identify the content creator.  
Websites are usually very clear about who is responsible for the website and who created the content on the page. There  
are many reasons for this:  
● People may want to showcase their own personal talent, experiences, and perspectives.  
● Artists, authors, musicians, and other original content creators may want to be known and appreciated.  
● Commercial websites may have copyrighted material they want to protect.  
● Businesses and organizations may want people to know who they are and what they do.  
● Stores want customers to feel comfortable buying their products online.  
Most websites have “contact us” or “about us” or “about” pages that provide information about who owns the site. Many  
companies have an entire website or blog devoted to who they are and what they are doing, what jobs are available, etc.  
Here are some examples:  
● Google Official Blog  
● Marriott Blog  
● Southwest Airlines Blog  
● Netflix Tech Blog

In PQ rating tasks, you will need to identify who created the MC on the page. To help you do so, the table below  
describes the primary content creators for common webpage types. These types can overlap (e.g., a page may have  
multiple articles, some written by individual authors or journalists and others written by the website owner).  
**Webpage Type Examples Primary Content Creator(s)**  
**The website owner created the page**  
**and much of the MC on the page**  
The page may have comments, reviews,  
or other content posted by users, but the  
page itself is the responsibility of the  
website.  
● Homepage of a business  
website  
● Introductory page on a  
personal website  
● Product page on an online  
merchant website  
The website itself can be viewed as the  
primary content creator. Website owners  
may have content created on their behalf  
(e.g., a small business may hire a  
professional web developer to build their  
website), but they are ultimately  
responsible for the MC.  
User comments and reviews may play a  
significant role on the page. As long as  
the website creates and actively  
maintains the page, the website is  
considered to be the primary content  
creator.  
**The website owner created the page,**  
**and the MC is produced by authors or**  
**other content creators identified by**  
**the website**  
The website decides what to publish and  
is responsible for the content, but there  
are distinct authors or content creators  
who provide the MC on the page.  
● Newspaper opinion piece  
written by the editorial  
board  
● Magazine article written by  
an individual journalist  
● Scientific journal paper  
written by a team of  
academic researchers  
The primary content creators are the  
journalists, scientists, etc. listed as  
authors of the content. Often the content  
creators are individuals, but an  
organization, company, or institution may  
also be the content creator.  
User comments may be present, but they  
typically are not the focus of the page.  
**The webpage consists of social media**  
**post(s) from a single account**  
**representing an individual content**  
**creator or organization**  
The social media website owner enables  
people and organizations to create  
accounts to post text, images, videos,  
and other types of content under their  
account.  
● Social media post  
● Local business profile  
page on a social media  
website  
● Video channel on a video  
sharing website  
The primary content creator is the person  
or organization who created the account  
and is posting the MC. There may be  
information about the content creator on  
a profile page found on the website.  
Other user comments and reactions such  
as "likes" may be considered part of the  
MC.  
**The webpage is created by multiple**  
**users engaging in discussion or**  
**posting on social media**  
The website owner enables people to  
post text, images, and videos or have  
conversations with other users of the  
website.  
● Forum discussion thread  
● Q\&A question page  
● Search results page on a  
social media website  
showing content from  
many different users  
The people posting are the content  
creators.  
There is no single primary content  
creator, and people may be identified  
only by aliases or usernames.

##### 2.5.3 Finding About Us, Contact Information, and Customer Service Information

Many websites are interested in communicating with their users. There are many reasons that users might have for  
contacting a website, from reporting problems such as broken pages, to asking for content removal. Many websites offer  
multiple ways for users to contact the website: email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, web contact forms,  
etc. Sometimes, this contact information is even organized by department and provides the names of individuals to  
contact.  
The types and amount of contact information needed depend on the type of website. Contact information and customer  
service information are extremely important for websites that handle money, such as stores, banks, credit card  
companies, etc. Users need a way to ask questions or get help when a problem occurs.  
For shopping websites, we'll ask you to do some special checks. Look for contact information—including the store’s  
policies on payment, exchanges, and returns. Sometimes this information is listed under “customer service.”  
Some kinds of websites need fewer details and a smaller amount of contact information for their purpose. For example,  
humor websites may not need the level of detailed contact information we would expect from online banking websites.  
Occasionally, you may encounter a website or content creator with a legitimate reason for anonymity. For example,  
personal websites may omit personal contact information such as an individual’s home address or phone number.  
Similarly, websites with user-generated content may allow the author to identify themself with an alias or username only.  
To find contact or customer service information for a website, start with the homepage. Look for a “contact us” or  
“customer service” link. Explore the website if you cannot find a “contact us” page. Sometimes you will find the contact  
information on a “corporate site” link or even on the company’s official social media page. Be a detective\!  
Note that different locales and different social media platforms may have their own conventions and standards for what  
information should be available on the website. Please use your judgment and knowledge of your locale.

### 3.0 Overall Page Quality Rating

Now that you are an expert in understanding websites and webpages, here are the high-level steps of Page Quality rating:

1. Assess the true purpose of the page. If the website or page has a harmful purpose or is designed to deceive  
   people about its true purpose, it should be rated **Lowest**.  
2. Assess the potential of the page to cause harm as described in these guidelines. Websites or pages that are  
   harmful to people or society, untrustworthy, or spammy as defined in these guidelines should be rated **Lowest**.  
3. Otherwise, the PQ rating is based on how well the page achieves its purpose as described in these guidelines.  
   **Important** : There are harmful pages that are seemingly “official”, “expert”, or “authoritative”. Any type of website may  
   have pages with harmful MC, from user-uploaded videos and forum posts to harmful products sold online to pages to  
   pages that mimic the look of scientific papers or encyclopedia entries. All pages should be evaluated for harm—including  
   pages on government websites, academic institutions, reputable online stores, charities, or other types of generally helpful  
   websites.  
   On Page Quality rating tasks, you will use the Page Quality sliding scale (slider) to assign the overall PQ rating. The  
   slider looks like this:  
   You may also use the in-between ratings of **Lowest+** , **Low+** , **Medium+** , and **High+**. Please interpret the “+” as “+ ½,”  
   meaning that the **Lowest+** rating is halfway between **Lowest** and **Low** , **Low+** is halfway between **Low** and **Medium** , etc.  
   Identifying **Lowest** and **Low** quality pages can be the most difficult part of PQ rating. The guidance in the sections on  
   **Lowest** and **Low** is more extensive to help you rate accurately. **High** and **Highest** quality pages are typically easier to  
   identify, but be sure to apply the standards and examine the examples throughout these guidelines to help calibrate your  
   ratings. As might be expected, **Medium** quality pages are commonly found online.

#### 3.1 Page Quality Rating Considerations

The following table summarizes the things that you should consider in Page Quality rating. Upcoming sections of these  
guidelines will elaborate on these considerations and explain how they apply to pages across the PQ rating scale.  
**Consideration Why it's Important for Page Quality Rating**  
The purpose of the page If the page has a harmful purpose, or if it is designed to deceive people about  
its true purpose or who is responsible for the content, it should be rated  
**Lowest**.  
Otherwise, PQ rating is the process of determining how well a page achieves  
its purpose.  
The potential for the page or website  
to cause harm as described in these  
guidelines  
Websites or pages that are harmful to people or society, untrustworthy, or  
spammy as described in these guidelines should be rated **Lowest**.  
The topic of the page and the extent  
to which that topic is YMYL  
The topic of the page helps determine the standards for your overall PQ  
assessment. Pages on YMYL topics have higher standards than pages on  
non-YMYL topics.

**Consideration Why it's Important for Page Quality Rating**  
The type of website Different types of websites and webpages have different expectations for PQ  
rating. For example, PQ expectations may differ for:  
● Small hobbyist websites vs. large corporate websites  
● Websites involving financial transactions vs. websites that do not  
require payment or collect personal information  
● Websites with content created by ordinary people on a volunteer basis  
vs. websites with content created by professionals  
Information provided by the website  
and content creator  
While the information that websites and content creators provide about  
themselves isn't always trustworthy, it can provide an important starting point.  
Quality of the MC Consider the extent to which the MC is satisfying and helps the page achieve  
its purpose.  
The title of the page The title of the page is considered part of the MC. Descriptive MC titles that  
summarize the page allow people to make informed decisions about what  
pages to visit.  
The role of Ads and SC on the page Consider the ways in which the Ads and SC contribute to how people  
experience the page.  
**Remember** : Many websites need monetization to share content with users.  
The presence or absence of Ads alone is not a consideration for PQ rating.  
Reputation of the website and content  
creator  
Research the reputation of the website and the content creator to learn about  
how others view the website and who is behind it.  
Trustworthiness of the page Assess how trustworthy the page is. Experience, Expertise and  
Authoritativeness can help with your assessment of Trust. Some types of  
pages require a high level of Trust.  
See Section 3.4 to learn more about Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness  
and Trust.  
**Important** : These considerations overlap. For example, while examining the quality of the MC, you may notice factual  
inaccuracies that lower your assessment of Trust. While conducting reputation research, you may find information about  
the expertise of the content creator which increases your level of Trust. This is how PQ rating is designed to work\!

#### 3.2 Quality of the Main Content

The quality of the Main Content (MC) is one of the most important considerations for PQ rating. The MC plays a major  
role in determining how well a page achieves its purpose.  
The unifying theme for evaluating the quality of the MC is the extent to which the MC allows the page to achieve its  
purpose and offers a satisfying user experience. For most pages, the quality of the MC can be determined by the amount  
of **effort** , **originality** , and **talent or skill** that went into the creation of the content. For informational pages and pages on  
YMYL topics, **accuracy** and consistency with well established expert consensus is important.  
**Effort** : Consider the extent to which a human being actively worked to create satisfying content. Effort may be  
direct, such as a person translating a poem from one language to another. Effort may go into designing page  
functionality or building systems that power a webpage, such as the creation of a page that offers machine  
translation as a service to users. On the other hand, the automatic creation of thousands of pages by running  
existing freely available content through existing translation software without any oversight, manual curation,  
etc., would not be considered to have effort.  
For pages like social media posts or forum discussions, the level of participation and depth of conversation is  
an important part of effort. Contributions from multiple individuals on such pages can add up to a significant  
amount of total human effort.  
**Originality** : Consider the extent to which the content offers unique, original content that is not available on  
other websites. If other websites have similar content, consider whether the page is the original source.  
**Talent or Skill** : Consider the extent to which the content is created with enough talent and skill to provide a  
satisfying experience for people who visit the page.  
**Accuracy** : For informational pages, consider the extent to which the content is factually accurate. For pages  
on YMYL topics, consider the extent to which the content is accurate and consistent with well-established  
expert consensus.  
The purpose of the page, topic of the page, and type of website all play a role in how to evaluate the quality of the MC.  
For example, consistency with well-established expert consensus is important for medical advice. Skill is important for  
how-to videos. Talent and originality is important for artistic expression. The amount of effort expected for a short video  
shared on social media is less than for a full-length, professionally produced documentary on a streaming video website,  
but both need sufficient effort to create satisfying content for their purpose. Think about what effort, originality, talent, or  
skill looks like for the type of page that you are evaluating.  
For each page you evaluate, spend a few minutes examining the MC before drawing a conclusion about it. Read the  
article, watch the video, examine the pictures, use the calculator, play the online game, etc. Remember that MC also  
includes page features and functionality, so test the page out. For example, if the page is a product page on a store  
website, put at least one product in the cart to make sure the shopping cart is functioning. If the page is an online game,  
try to play the game yourself. Do your best to imagine that you are someone who's very interested in the topic,  
functionality, or purpose served by the page, then think about how satisfying the MC would be for that person.  
High and low quality MC comes in all formats (e.g., text, audio, video, images) and all lengths (e.g., short-form videos and  
full-length professional documentaries). High and low quality content also exists on all types of websites, from small  
personal sites to large corporate sites, from forums and social media to websites that handle financial transactions. Think  
carefully about what helps the page achieve its purpose and what makes the MC satisfying for users.

#### 3.3 Reputation of the Website and Content Creators

An important part of PQ rating is understanding the reputation of the website. If the website is not the primary creator of  
the MC, it’s important to research the reputation of the content creator as well.  
Reputation research should be performed according to the topic of the page. For example, if the page contains medical  
information, research the reputation of the website and content creator for providing medical information. It's possible for  
a website to be a go-to source for one type of content (e.g., humorous videos), but an untrustworthy source for a different  
type of content (e.g., financial information).  
A website's or content creator's reputation can also help you understand what a website or content creator is best known  
for. For example, newspapers may be known for high quality, independent investigative reporting while satire websites  
may be known for their humor. An individual journalist (content creator) may be known for the clarity of their scientific  
articles while a food blogger (content creator) may be known for the deliciousness of the recipes they post online.  
Note that a company or person may create content on many different websites. For example, a newspaper might have  
their own website, upload their video content to a video sharing website, post updates on social media, and contribute  
content to a TV channel. An expert on a topic might publish research papers, have a lengthy blog, and share short  
updates on social media. In these cases, you should research the underlying company or content creator.  
Reputation research is especially important for detecting untrustworthy websites and content creators. Content may look  
great on the surface, but reputation research can expose scams, fraud, or other signs of harm. You never know what you  
will find unless you look\! Therefore, reputation research is required for all PQ rating tasks.

##### 3.3.1 Reputation of the Website

A website's reputation is based on the experience of real users and the opinions of people who are experts. Websites  
may represent real companies, organizations, and other entities. Reputation research applies to both the website and the  
actual company, organization, or entity that the website is representing.  
Many websites are eager to tell users how great they are. Your job is to independently evaluate the Page Quality of the  
website, not just accept information that appears on one or two pages of the website without further verification. Be  
skeptical of claims that websites make about themselves, particularly when there is a clear conflict of interest.  
Instead, look for independent reviews, references, recommendations by experts, news articles, and other sources of  
credible information about the website. Look for information written by a person or organization, not statistics or other  
machine-compiled information. News articles, Wikipedia articles, blog posts, magazine articles, forum discussions, and  
ratings from independent organizations can all be great sources of reputation information.  
For YMYL topics, the reputation of a website should be judged by what experts in the field have to say.  
Recommendations from expert sources, such as professional societies, are strong evidence of a positive reputation.  
Sources of reputation information will also vary according to the topic or type of company/organization/entity that the  
website represents. For example, you might find that a newspaper (with an associated website) has won journalistic  
awards. Prestigious awards or a history of high-quality original reporting are strong evidence of positive reputation for  
news websites.  
Note that some types of information about a website is not related to its reputation. For example, websites like Similarweb  
have information about Internet traffic to the website, but do not provide evidence of positive or negative reputation. You  
can ignore this type of information since it's not helpful for PQ rating.

##### 3.3.2 Customer Reviews as Reputation Information

Customer reviews can be helpful for assessing the reputation of a store, business, or any website that offers products or  
services to users. You may consider a large number of detailed, trustworthy, positive user reviews as evidence of positive  
reputation for a store or business.  
However, you should interpret customer reviews with care, particularly if there are only a few. Keep the following in mind:  
● **Be skeptical of both positive and negative reviews.** Anyone can write them, including the website owner or  
someone whom the store or business hires for this purpose.  
● **Try to find as many reviews as possible.** Any store or business can get a few negative reviews—this is  
completely normal and expected. Large stores and companies receive thousands of reviews, and most receive  
some negative ones.  
● **Read the reviews because the content of the reviews matter, not just the number or star rating.** Credible,  
convincing reports of fraud and financial wrongdoing is evidence of extremely negative reputation. On the other  
hand, a single encounter with a rude clerk or the delayed receipt of a single package should not be considered  
negative reputation information. Please use your judgment.

##### 3.3.3 How to Search for Reputation Information about a Website

Here is how to research the reputation of the website:

1. Identify the “homepage” of the website. For example, for the IBM website, ibm.com is the homepage. You may  
   need to identify the content creator, if it is different from that of the overall website.  
2. Using ibm.com as an example, try one or more of the following searches on Google:  
   ● \[ibm \-site:ibm.com\] \- A search for IBM that excludes pages on ibm.com.  
   ● \[“ibm.com” \-site:ibm.com\] \- A search for “ibm.com” that excludes pages on ibm.com.  
   ● \[ibm reviews \-site:ibm.com\] \- A search for reviews of IBM that excludes pages on ibm.com.  
   ● \[“ibm.com” reviews \-site:ibm.com\] \- A search for reviews of “ibm.com” that excludes pages on ibm.com.  
   **Note** : When searching for reputation information, try to find sources that were not written or created by the  
   website or the company itself. For example, IBM might have official social media pages that it closely maintains,  
   which would not be considered independent sources of reputation information about the company. See here for a  
   Wikipedia article on identifying and using independent sources.  
3. Look for articles, references, recommendations by experts, and other credible information written by people about  
   the website.  
   High quality news articles and informational articles may be good sources of reputation information. Search for  
   such articles. For example, try \[ibm site:en.wikipedia.org\]. News articles and informational articles can help you  
   learn about a company and may include information specific to reputation, such as awards and other forms of  
   recognition, or also controversies and issues. Note that some informational articles include a message warning  
   users that there are disagreements on some of the content, or that the content may be outdated. This may be an  
   indication that additional research is necessary.  
4. Make sure the information you find is appropriate for judging the reputation of the website. For example,  
   reputation information for YMYL topics should come from sources that have expertise in the associated YMYL  
   topic.

Here are some examples of reputation information:

##### 3.3.4 Reputation of the Content Creators

For individual authors and content creators, biographical information articles and online discussions can be a good source  
of reputation information. Expect to find more formal reputation information about people who create content in a  
journalistic, scientific, academic, or other traditionally professional capacity, as they often need online credibility for  
professional success. Educational degrees, peer validation, expert co-authors, and citations can be evidence of positive  
reputation information for professionals who publish their work. Employment history can also support a positive reputation  
for topics where training, credentials, or experience are important.  
Influencers and other individual content creators who earn income on social media platforms often have reputation  
information available as well, ranging from from biographical details or news articles to less formal reputation sources  
such as comments by other influencers in their fields.  
For non-professional content creators including ordinary people who post on social media or forums, you may find  
informal reputation information on the page itself such as comments by other people about the creators. For example,  
you may find comments or posts from other users helpful to see what other people think about a particular content creator.

##### 3.3.5 What to Do When You Find No Reputation Information

You should expect to find some reputation information for large websites and well-known content creators. People or  
businesses who create content in a professional capacity typically have some reputation information available.  
However, small websites may have little or no reputation information. This is not indicative of high or low quality. Many  
small local businesses or community organizations have a small “web presence” and rely on word of mouth.  
Furthermore, many ordinary people participate in forum discussions or post on social media websites in a personal  
capacity. People may use an alias or username to post in order to avoid sharing personally identifiable information online.  
There may be no reputation information available for some individuals. A lack of reputation about people who post  
personal content is neither a positive nor a negative sign in your assessment of the page.  
Finally, remember that there are several important considerations involved in PQ rating (refer back to Section 3.1 ).  
Reputation is important, but if reputation information is not available for a website or content creator, pay extra attention to  
other PQ considerations, especially when assessing pages on YMYL topics.

#### 3.4 Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trust (E-E-A-T)

Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trust (E-E-A-T) are all important considerations in PQ rating. The most  
important member at the center of the E-E-A-T family is Trust.  
**Trust** : Consider the extent to which the page is accurate, honest, safe, and reliable.  
The type and amount of **Trust** needed depends on the page, for example:  
● **Online stores** need secure online payment systems and reliable customer service.  
● **Product reviews** should be honest and written to help others make informed purchasing decisions (rather than  
solely to sell the product).  
● **Informational pages on clear YMYL topics** must be accurate to prevent harm to people and society.  
● **Social media posts on non-YMYL topics** may not need a high level of Trust, such as when the purpose of the  
post is to entertain its audience and the content of the post does not risk causing harm.  
**Experience** , **Expertise** and **Authoritativeness** are important concepts that can support your assessment of Trust:  
**Experience** : Consider the extent to which the content creator has the necessary first-hand or life experience for  
the topic. Many types of pages are trustworthy and achieve their purpose well when created by people with a  
wealth of personal experience. For example, which would you trust: a product review from someone who has  
personally used the product or a "review" by someone who has not?  
**Expertise** : Consider the extent to which the content creator has the necessary knowledge or skill for the topic.  
Different topics require different levels and types of expertise to be trustworthy. For example, which would you  
trust: home electrical rewiring advice from a skilled electrician or from an antique homes enthusiast who has no  
knowledge of electrical wiring?  
**Authoritativeness:** Consider the extent to which the content creator or the website is known as a go-to source  
for the topic. While most topics do not have one official, Authoritative website or content creator, when they do,  
that website or content creator is often among the most reliable and trustworthy sources. For example, a local  
business profile page on social media may be the authoritative and trusted source for what is on sale now. The  
official government page for getting a passport is the unique, official, and authoritative source for passport  
renewal.  
**Experience** , **Expertise** , and **Authoritativeness** may overlap for some page types and topics (for example, someone may  
develop Expertise in a topic due to first-hand Experience accumulated over time), and different combinations of E-E-A  
may be relevant to different topics. You should consider the purpose, type, and topic of the page, then ask yourself what  
would make the content creator a trustworthy source in that context.

**Trust** is the most important member of the E-E-A-T family because untrustworthy pages have low E-E-A-T no matter how  
Experienced, Expert, or Authoritative they may seem. For example, a financial scam is untrustworthy, even if the content  
creator is a highly experienced and expert scammer who is considered the go-to on running scams\!  
When it comes to Page Quality rating, your assessment of E-E-A-T should be informed by one or more of the following:  
● **What the website or content creators say about themselves:** Look at the "About us" page on the website or  
profile page of the content creator as a starting point. Is the website or content creator a trustworthy source  
based on this information?  
● **What others say about the website or content creators:** Look for independent reviews, references, news  
articles, and other sources of credible information about the website or content creators. Is there independent,  
reliable evidence that the website or content creator is experienced, has expertise, is authoritative, or is otherwise  
considered trustworthy? Is there independent, reliable evidence that the website or creator is untrustworthy?  
● **What is visible on the page, including the Main Content and sections such as reviews and comments:** For  
some types of pages, the level of experience and expertise may be clear from the MC itself. What evidence can  
you gather from examining the MC or testing the page out? For example, you may be able to tell that someone is  
an expert in hair styling by watching a video of them in action (styling someone's hair) and reading others'  
comments (commenters often highlight expertise or lack thereof).  
**Important** : The website or content creator may not be a trustworthy source if there is a clear conflict of interest. For  
example, product reviews by people who own the product and share their experiences can be very valuable and  
trustworthy. However, "reviews" by the product manufacturer ( *"Our product is great\!"* ) or "reviews" from an influencer who  
is paid to promote the product are not as trustworthy due to the conflict of interest.  
Finally, there are many aspects of Trust, some which are not captured by Experience, Expertise and Authoritativeness.  
Please consider other aspects in your overall Trust assessment, such as customer service information for online stores or  
peer-reviewed publications for academic authors. If a page is untrustworthy for any reason *,* it has low E-E-A-T.

##### 3.4.1 YMYL Topics: Experience or Expertise?

Pages on YMYL topics can be created for a wide variety of different purposes. If the purpose of a page on a clear YMYL  
topic is to give information or offer advice, a high level of expertise may be required for the page to be trustworthy.  
However, sometimes pages on YMYL topics are created to share personal experiences, often regarding difficult life  
challenges. People turn to each other in times of need to share their own experience, seek comfort or inspiration, and  
learn from others. Factual information from experts and authoritative sources may not satisfy this need.  
Pages that share first-hand life experience on clear YMYL topics may be considered to have high E-E-A-T as long as the  
content is trustworthy, safe, and consistent with well-established expert consensus. In contrast, some types of YMYL  
information and advice must come from experts.  
Here are some examples:  
**YMYL Topic** Valuable sharing of life **Experience** Information or advice best left to **Experts**  
Sleep challenges when  
pregnant  
*(YMYL Health or Safety)*  
Safe and non-medical tips and tricks for  
sleeping in the last trimester of pregnancy,  
provided by people who have personally  
struggled with this challenge, for example:  
how to use pillows to sleep comfortably in  
a position that is safe for babies  
Sleep medications that are safe during  
pregnancy  
Liver cancer treatment  
*(YMYL Health or Safety)*  
A sincere and respectful forum discussion  
where people are describing how they're  
coping with liver cancer treatment  
Different treatment options for liver cancer  
and the associated life expectancies  
under each treatment  
Filling out tax forms  
*(YMYL Financial Security)*  
A humorous video from a non-expert  
content creator about the frustration of  
doing taxes  
Instructions on how to fill out tax forms  
Saving for retirement  
*(YMYL Financial Security)*  
Reviews of retirement saving services by  
people with first-hand experience using  
these services  
Advice on how to invest for retirement:  
how much to save, what kinds of assets to  
invest in, how much money you will need  
to retire by a specific age, etc.  
How to vote

A social media post by an ordinary citizen  
describing why they personally believe it's  
important to vote in local elections  
Information about who is eligible to vote or  
how to register to vote

### 4.0 Lowest Quality Pages

**Lowest** quality pages are untrustworthy, deceptive, harmful to people or society, or have other highly undesirable  
characteristics. The considerations for **Lowest** quality include quality of the MC, reputation, E-E-A-T, etc., but there are  
special checks you will need to complete first.  
As a reminder, here are the steps for doing PQ rating:

1. Assess the true purpose of the page. If the website or page has a harmful purpose or is designed to deceive  
   people about its true purpose, it should be rated **Lowest**.  
2. Assess the potential of the page to cause harm as described in these guidelines. Websites or pages that are  
   harmful to people or society, untrustworthy, or spammy as specified in these guidelines should receive the  
   **Lowest** rating.  
3. Otherwise, the PQ rating is based on how well the page achieves its purpose using the criteria outlined in these  
   guidelines.  
   Steps 1 and 2 are a screening process to quickly detect harmful content before other PQ considerations are applied.  
   To identify **Lowest** quality pages, start by considering the following:  
   Initial Consideration **Lowest** Quality Pages  
   The purpose of the page **The Lowest rating is required** if the page has a harmful purpose, or if  
   it is designed to deceive people about its true purpose or who is  
   responsible for the content on the page.  
   **The Lowest rating is required** if the page is created to benefit the  
   owner of the website (e.g. to make money) with very little or no attempt  
   to benefit website visitors or otherwise serve a beneficial purpose.  
   The potential for the page to cause harm as  
   described in these guidelines  
   **The Lowest rating is required** if the MC is harmful to self or others,  
   harmful to specified groups, or contains harmfully misleading  
   information.  
   The topic of the page, the type of website, and  
   the extent to which YMYL standards apply  
   A page on any topic or any type of website may qualify for **Lowest.**  
   Give special scrutiny to pages or websites needing a high level of  
   trust, such as online stores, medical websites, or news coverage of  
   major civic issues.

Next, assess the page to determine if any of the criteria for **Lowest** apply:  
**Lowest** Page Quality Assessment Any one of the following is justification for **Lowest**  
Quality of the MC ● The page is hacked, defaced, or spammed.  
● The page is gibberish or otherwise makes no sense.  
● The MC is created with little to no effort, has little to no originality  
and the MC adds no value compared to similar pages on the  
web.  
● The MC is created with so little effort, originality, talent, or skill  
that the page fails to achieve its purpose.  
The title of the page The page title is extremely misleading, shocking, or exaggerated.  
The role of Ads and SC on the page The MC is deliberately obstructed or obscured due to Ads, SC,  
interstitial pages, download links or other content that is beneficial to  
the website owner but not necessarily the website visitor.  
Information provided by the website and  
content creator  
A complete lack of information about who is responsible for the  
website and its content for YMYL pages or other pages requiring trust.  
Reputation of the website and content creator A very negative reputation, including a reputation for malicious or  
harmful behavior.  
Trustworthiness of the page: E-E-A-T ● The page or website is highly untrustworthy.  
● The lack of experience, expertise, authoritativeness or trust  
causes the page to fail to achieve its purpose.

#### 4.1 Types of Lowest Quality Pages

There are many different shapes and forms that **Lowest** pages can take. To help you keep track, the table below  
organizes **Lowest** pages into three broad categories: Harmful, Untrustworthy, and Spammy. These categories can  
overlap (e.g., pages that contain Harmfully Misleading Information are also Untrustworthy).  
Type of **Lowest** Page **Description Reference Section**  
Harmful to Self or  
Other Individuals  
Pages that encourage, depict, incite or directly cause physical, mental,  
emotional or financial harm to self or other individuals.  
Examples include:  
● Detailed instructions on how to commit suicide  
● Detailed, realistic, and serious instructions written with the  
intent to help someone commit murder  
Section 4.2  
Harmful to Specified  
Groups  
Pages that promote, condone, or incite violence or hatred against a  
Specified Group of people (as defined in Section 4.3).  
Examples include:  
● Content that encourages violence or ill treatment towards a  
Specified Group  
● Content with extremely offensive/dehumanizing stereotypes of  
a Specified Group  
Section 4.3  
Harmfully Misleading  
Information  
Pages that misinform people in a way that could cause harm.  
Examples include:  
● Clearly inaccurate harmful information that can easily be  
refuted by straightforward and widely accepted facts  
● Harmful unsubstantiated theories/claims not grounded in any  
reasonable facts or evidence  
Section 4.4  
Untrustworthy  
Webpages  
Pages or websites that are deceptive or have untrustworthy  
characteristics.  
Examples include:  
● Pages or websites with deceptive purpose or design  
● Pages or websites designed to manipulate people into actions  
that benefit the website or other organization while causing  
harm to self, others or Specified Groups  
Section 4.5  
Spammy Webpages Pages with characteristics of webspam as defined in the Google  
Search Essentials Guidelines and/or Section 4.6 of these guidelines.  
Examples include:  
● Pages deliberately created with no MC or gibberish MC  
● Hacked, defaced, or spammed pages  
Section 4.6  
**Important** : There is lots of content that many people would find controversial, one-sided, off-putting, or distasteful, yet  
does not meet the criteria for **Lowest** as described in these guidelines. Use your judgment to follow the standards  
outlined throughout Section 4.0 rather than relying on personal opinions.

#### 4.2 Harmful to Self or Other Individuals

Use the **Lowest** rating for pages with content that encourages, depicts, incites, or directly causes harm to self or other  
individuals.  
Harm includes physical, mental, emotional, or financial harm to people. Pages should be considered Harmful to Self or  
Other Individuals if they directly attempt to harm people; encourage behavior that may result in harm; depict extremely  
violent or gory content without a beneficial/educational purpose; or otherwise are severely traumatic to people who view  
the page.  
Pages do not have to be harmful to *all* people to be considered Harmful to Self or Other Individuals. Different people have  
different levels of vulnerability to scams, awareness of potential dangers (e.g., dangerous feats depicted in stunt videos),  
and tolerance for viewing violent/disturbing content. If there is a reasonable possibility that viewing a particular page  
would cause harm to those who are most vulnerable, it should be considered harmful**.**  
Pages created with a beneficial purpose that report on, discuss, or inform about harmful actions or events (e.g., fictional  
entertainment, reputable news, education) should typically not be considered Harmful to Self or Other Individuals. For  
example, advocacy aimed at drawing attention to harmful, real-world actions or events (such as a webpage describing a  
protest against domestic violence) would not be considered Harmful to Self or Other Individuals.  
Here are some examples of content that is vs. is not considered Harmful to Self or Other Individuals:  
**Harmful to Self or Other Individuals NOT Harmful to Self or Other Individuals**  
● Incitement of violence towards Other Individuals  
● Serious death threats or realistic-sounding threats  
● Exposing personal information belonging to others  
with malicious intent to target them or promote  
harassment towards them (i.e., “doxxing”)  
● How-to information that describes how to commit  
violent acts in an easy-to-replicate way  
● Advocating for, glorifying, or trivializing violence  
and atrocities, or to disparage victim(s) of  
violence/atrocities  
● Depicting or promoting information that facilitates  
or leads to serious harm to people, or discussions  
that attempt to justify abuse of people  
● Encouraging unsafe behavior or substantially  
downplays the risks of dangerous activities (e.g.,  
consuming household cleaning products)  
● Suicide promotion or pro-anorexia content that  
encourages people to engage in behavior that can  
result in hospitalization or death  
● Health-related advice that contradicts  
well-established expert consensus and could  
result in serious harm or could prevent someone  
from undertaking a life-saving treatment  
● Depictions of violence in an action movie  
● A news story about violent events  
● Educational content that may depict violence or  
gross imagery  
● An explanation of scams meant to raise  
awareness about them  
● Portrayals of dangerous activities in a manner that  
discourages others from attempting the same feat  
(such as by clearly explaining the risks, describing  
the expertise and equipment required, etc.)

#### 4.3 Harmful to Specified Groups

Use the **Lowest** rating for pages that promote, condone, or incite hatred against a Specified Group of people.  
For the purposes of Search Quality rating, a Specified Group is a group of people that can be defined on the basis of:  
● Age (e.g., older adults)  
● Caste (e.g., Dalits)  
● Disability (e.g., people who are blind)  
● Ethnicity (e.g., Roma)  
● Gender Identity and Expression (e.g., transgender people)  
● Immigration Status (e.g., student visa holders)  
● Nationality (e.g., Italians)  
● Race (e.g., Asians)  
● Religion (e.g., Christians)  
● Sex/Gender (e.g., men)  
● Sexual Orientation (e.g., lesbians)  
● Veteran Status (e.g., Marines)  
● Victims of a major violent event and their kin (e.g., victims of the Holocaust)  
● Any other characteristic that is associated with systemic discrimination or marginalization (e.g., refugees, people  
experiencing homelessness)  
The tone of the harmful content must be either serious (i.e., not joking or satirical) or mean-spirited (i.e., with an intent to  
demean or promote intolerance) to be considered Harmful to Specified Groups. Comedy or artistic expression related to  
a Specified Group should not be considered harmful unless it is clearly mean-spirited or has other clear harmful impact.  
Criticism of objects, philosophies, and ideas are generally not considered Harmful to Specified Groups. For example,  
negative criticism of a religious doctrine should not be considered targeted at the Specified Group that follows that  
religion. Remember that the content must promote, condone, or incite hatred of *people* to be considered Harmful to  
Specified Groups.  
Educational pages (e.g., definitions, research, academic papers), news stories, or other pages that have a beneficial  
purpose of informing society should not be considered Harmful to Specified Groups. Similarly, historical  
documents/videos that aim to capture the beliefs of different eras should not be considered Harmful to Specified Groups.  
Here are some examples of content that is vs. is not considered Harmful to Specified Groups:  
**Harmful to Specified Groups NOT Harmful to Specified Groups**  
● Encourages violence or ill treatment towards a  
Specified Group  
● Promotes intolerance by demonstrating a staunch  
unwillingness to allow for the views, beliefs, or  
behavior of a Specified Group  
● Implies that one Specified Group is superior or  
inferior to another  
● Contains extremely offensive/dehumanizing  
stereotypes of a Specified Group. Note that  
stereotypes can be negative or positive.  
● A historical documentary of WWII featuring  
speeches from Nazi leaders  
● A stand-up comedy routine that plays off of  
stereotypes in a way that is not mean-spirited  
● A newspaper article about a hate organization  
● The dictionary definition of a slur  
● A discussion about a particular religious text and  
its views on women

#### 4.4 Harmfully Misleading Information

Use the **Lowest** rating for pages that mislead people in ways that can cause harm to people and society.  
Misleading pages may have been produced with the intent to misinform people, or the content creator may believe that  
the inaccurate information they are sharing is true. There is an especially high standard for accuracy on clear YMYL  
topics or other topics where inaccurate information can cause harm. Be sure to research consequential facts or claims as  
necessary and to the extent the task time allows.  
Pages should be considered to contain Harmfully Misleading Information when they contain *at least one of the following:*  
**Type of Harmfully**  
**Misleading Information**  
**Description Examples**  
Harmful and clearly  
inaccurate information  
Content that can be refuted by  
straightforward and widely accepted facts  
● False claims that a world leader died  
● False dates for an election  
Harmful claims that contradict  
well-established expert  
consensus  
Content that is inconsistent with positions,  
facts, or findings that are widely agreed  
upon by authorities in the relevant field  
● Claims that lemons cure cancer  
● Claims that buying lottery tickets is a  
guaranteed way to save for retirement  
Harmful unsubstantiated  
theories/claims  
Content that is not grounded in any  
reasonable facts or evidence, especially  
those that could erode confidence in  
public institutions. This includes  
unsubstantiated theories that have been  
thoroughly debunked or are too outlandish  
to be given credence.  
● Claims that the 9-11 attacks were  
planned by the U.S. government  
● Claims that world leaders are lizard  
people  
Harmfully Misleading Information can occur from any websites or content creators \- even seemingly "expert",  
"authoritative" or "official" ones. Any type of page with Harmfully Misleading Information should be rated Lowest,  
regardless of the source.  
However, note that some types of information are subjective, debatable, unverifiable, or inconsequential. For example,  
pages should not be considered to contain Harmfully Misleading Information if they *exclusively* contain:  
● Non-YMYL content created with a clear entertainment purpose, containing no hard claims of factual accuracy and  
are not harmful to people or society. Examples include many types of fiction, satire or parody, astrology, folklore,  
myths, and urban legends.  
● Reviews expressing personal preferences, opinions, or value-based judgments about a product, restaurant,  
book/movie/TV show, etc.  
● Claims or statements that are reasonably debatable when there is not a single established correct answer or truth  
(e.g., discussions about the relative effectiveness of different healthcare systems)  
● Insignificant errors or inaccurate information about a trivial topic (e.g., inaccuracies in the height of a celebrity)  
Pages that aim to persuade others that a certain position or perspective is correct are fairly common on the Internet.  
Pages with one-sided/opinionated/controversial/polarizing content should not be considered to contain Harmfully  
Misleading Information unless they could create harm to individuals or Specified Groups (as described above) and contain  
clearly inaccurate information, contradict well-established expert consensus, or are not grounded by reasonable  
facts/evidence.  
A webpage may be considered to have Harmfully Misleading Information based on the MC or on other characteristics of  
the page or information about the content creator (e.g., the title of an article is harmfully misleading, even if the article on  
its own is not; a creator blatantly misrepresenting their medical credentials for a video on medical topics).  
Harmfully Misleading Information can be especially hard to identify because it may require research from outside sources.  
Reputable fact-checking websites can't always keep up with the volume of unsubstantiated theories/claims produced by

the Internet, and some theories may even claim that debunking information is inaccurate. You should attempt to find  
high-quality, trustworthy sources to check accuracy and seek out the consensus of experts if you are unsure. Please  
research theories and claims to the extent the task time allows. If a theory/claim seems wildly improbable and can't be  
verified by independent trustworthy sources, you should consider it unsubstantiated.

#### 4.5 Untrustworthy Webpages or Websites

The **Lowest** rating should be used for pages or websites you strongly suspect are engaging in deceptive or malicious  
practices.  
Some untrustworthy pages are created to benefit the website or organization rather than helping people. Some  
untrustworthy pages may even exist to cause harm to people who engage with the page, such as scams or malicious  
downloads.  
Your assessment of untrustworthiness may be based on the content of the page, information about the website,  
information about the content creator, and the reputation of the website or content creator.  
Your assessment may also be based on a *lack* of critically important information. For example, any website involving  
financial transactions or sensitive information should have comprehensive information about who is responsible for the  
site and a way to contact the site if something goes wrong. If some aspect of a page or website makes you suspect  
deception or maliciousness, please look for information about the site. If you cannot find reputation information to confirm  
your suspicion, carefully explore the site.  
Sometimes a single page on an unknown website in isolation may seem odd but subsequent exploration shows no  
concern. However, if you see a pattern of what appears to be deception or manipulation or become concerned about your  
own safety, please use the **Lowest** rating and leave the website immediately.  
Pages with the following characteristics should be considered Untrustworthy:  
● Multiple or significant factual inaccuracies on an informational page which would cause users to lose trust in the  
webpage as a reliable source of information  
● Inadequate information about the website or content creator for its purpose  
● Lowest E-E-A-T or Lowest reputation  
● Deceptive purpose, deceptive page design, or deceptive intent  
● Deliberately obstructed or obscured MC  
● Characteristics of scams, malicious downloads, or other harmful behavior  
● Any webpage or website designed to manipulate people into actions that benefit the website or other organization  
while causing harm to self, others, or Specified Groups  
**Important** : Highly untrustworthy pages should be given the **Lowest** rating even if you are unable to "prove" the webpage  
or site is harmful. Because many people are unwilling to use a highly untrustworthy page, an untrustworthy page or  
website fails to achieve its purpose.

##### 4.5.1 Inadequate Information about the Website or Content Creator for the Purpose of the Page

For pages that require a high level of trust, information about who created the content and who is responsible for the  
content is critical.  
As discussed in Section 2.5.3 , we expect most websites to have some information about who (e.g., what individual,  
company, business, foundation, etc.) is responsible for the website and who created the MC and some contact  
information, unless there is a good reason for anonymity. As you will see in the examples below, many types of **Lowest**  
pages such as malicious downloads and scams typically have no information or fake information about who is responsible  
to prevent recourse by people who are harmed.

Any site that handles personal, private or sensitive data must provide extensive contact information. This includes sites  
that ask users to create passwords, share personal information, or conduct financial transactions.  
YMYL pages or websites that handle sensitive data with absolutely no information about the website or content creator  
should be rated **Lowest**.

##### 4.5.2 Lowest E-E-A-T and Lowest Reputation of the Website or Content Creator

If the E-E-A-T of a page is low enough, people cannot or should not use the MC of the page. If a page on YMYL topics is  
highly inexpert, it should be considered Untrustworthy and rated **Lowest**.  
Use the **Lowest** rating if the website and content creator have an extremely negative reputation, to the extent that many  
people would consider the webpage or website untrustworthy.  
Here are some examples originally shown in Section 3.3.3. All pages on these websites should be rated **Lowest** because  
of the credible extremely negative or malicious reputation of these websites, making them untrustworthy.  
**Note** : These website examples may be considered Harmful in some form as well. Sometimes reputation research  
exposes information that may not meet the criteria for considering a website harmful but does cause it to be untrustworthy.  
**Website Description**  
Site selling children’s jungle gym  
**Evidence of fraudulent behavior** : There are many reviews on websites describing how users  
sent money and did not receive anything in return. There is also a news article about this  
business engaging in financial fraud.  
Site selling products related to  
eyewear  
**Evidence of criminal behavior** : This website engaged in criminal behavior such as physically  
threatening users.  
Organization serving the  
hospitalized veteran community  
**Evidence of fraudulent behavior** : There are many detailed negative articles on news sites and  
charity watchdog sites describing fraud and financial mishandling about this organization.

##### 4.5.3 Deceptive Page Purpose, Deceptive Information about the Website, Deceptive Design

All pages or websites using deception of any type should be rated **Lowest** because they are Untrustworthy. Here are  
some types of deception to look for during Page Quality rating.  
**Type of Deception Description**  
**Deceptive Purpose** The page or the website superficially appear to have one purpose, but in fact exist for a  
different reason.  
**Deceptive Information about**  
**the Website or Content**  
**Creators**  
The website has deliberately inaccurate or misleading information about the website or  
content creators to make the website appear trustworthy.  
**Deceptive Design**  
The page or content is deliberately designed to look like one type of page or content but  
in fact functions as another.  
**Note** : No list of deceptive page types will be complete—deceptive websites continue to evolve as people and search  
engines figure out how they are being tricked.

Please see below for some examples.  
Deceptive purpose:  
● **A webpage with deliberately inaccurate information to promote products in order to make money from**  
**clicks on monetized links.** Examples include a product recommendation page on a website falsely  
impersonating a celebrity blog, or a product recommendation based on a false claim of personal, independent  
testing when no such testing was conducted.  
● **A webpage claims to offer an independent review or share other information about a product, but is in**  
**fact created to make money for the owner of the website without attempting to help users.** For example,  
the MC may contain intentionally misleading or inaccurate information created with the sole purpose of getting  
users to click on monetized links or buy the product.  
Deceptive information about the website or content creators:  
● **A webpage or website that impersonates a different site** (e.g., copied logo or branding of an unaffiliated site,  
URL that mimics another site's name, etc.)  
**● A non-satirical social network profile made by an impersonator**.  
● **A webpage or website that looks like a news source or information page, but in fact has articles to**  
**manipulate users** in order to benefit a person, business, government, or other organization politically, monetarily,  
or otherwise.  
● **A website claims to be the personal website of a celebrity, but the website is actually created to make**  
**money for the owner of the website without the permission of the celebrity.** For example, the page may  
have false testimonials for a product and is created for the sole purpose of getting users to click on monetized  
links or buy the product.  
● **A webpage or website with deceptive business information.** For example, a website may claim to have a  
physical "brick and mortar" store but in fact only exists online. While there is nothing wrong with being an online  
business, claiming to have a physical "brick and mortar" (e.g. fake photo, fake physical store address) is  
deceptive.  
● **A webpage or website with "fake" owner or content creator profiles.** For example, AI generated content with  
made up "author" profiles (AI generated images or deceptive creator descriptions) in order to make it appear that  
the content is written by people.  
● **Factually inaccurate and deceptive information about creator expertise.** For example, an author or creator  
profile inaccurately claims to have credentials or expertise (e.g. the content creator claims falsely to be a medical  
professional) to make the content appear more trustworthy than it is.  
Deceptive design:  
● **Pages that disguise Ads as MC**. Actual MC may be minimal or created to encourage users to click on the Ads.  
For example, fake search pages ( example ) that have a list of links that look like a page of search results. If you  
click on a few of the links, you will see that the page is just a collection of Ads disguised as search engine results.  
A “search box” is present, but submitting a new query just gives you a different page of Ads disguised as search  
results.  
● **Pages that disguise Ads as website navigation links**. For example, fake directory pages ( example ) that look  
like a personally curated set of helpful links, possibly with unique descriptions. In reality, the links are Ads or links  
to other similar pages on the site. Sometimes the descriptions of the links are unrelated to the page.  
● **Pages with deceptively designed buttons or links**. For example, buttons or links on pop ups, interstitials or on  
the page are designed to look like they do one thing (such as close a pop up) but in fact have a different result  
which most people would not expect, e.g. download an app.  
● **Pages with a misleading title or a title that has nothing to do with the content on the page.** People who  
come to the page expecting content related to the title will feel tricked or deceived.  
Take a good look at the page and use your judgment. If you believe the true purpose of the page is not what it appears to  
be, the page should be rated **Lowest.** If you believe the page was deliberately created with the primary purpose to  
manipulate users to click on Ads, monetized links, questionable download links, etc., rather than to help people, the page

should be rated **Lowest.** If the website has any form of deceptive or significantly misleading information about itself, or if  
the page or website uses deception in any form even if not described here, the page should be rated **Lowest.**

##### 4.5.4 Deliberately Obstructed or Obscured MC

Pages are untrustworthy if the MC is deliberately obstructed or obscured due to Ads, SC, interstitial pages, download links  
or other content that is beneficial to the website owner but not necessarily the website visitor. Attempts to manipulate or  
coerce users away from the MC is evidence of untrustworthiness.  
Here are some examples of pages with deliberately obstructed or obscured MC that should be rated **Lowest** :  
● Ads that continue to cover the MC as the website visitor scrolls down the page. The Ads are virtually impossible  
to close without clicking on the Ad  
● Pop-ups that obscure the MC and cannot be closed without taking an action that benefits the website  
● An interstitial page that attempts to coerce a download or click that does not benefit the website visitor  
● Ads that push the MC down so far that many users would not notice the MC  
● MC in white-on-white text or MC presented so that it is difficult for a human being to read  
Logins or paywalls on otherwise trustworthy sites should not be considered untrustworthy, deceptive, or coercive. Many  
high quality sites such as newspapers or magazines cannot exist without monetization through subscriptions and  
paywalls. Some types of MC should be login protected, such as pages with personal information online banking websites  
or private pages on social network websites.  
MC may be inaccessible for non-deliberate or non-coercive reasons, such as content that doesn't load or content that is  
unavailable in a country or region. These are not reasons for **Lowest**.  
Use your judgment to assess whether the page is designed to manipulate or coerce users into taking actions that benefit  
the website. If you are unsure, look at other pages on the same website, conduct reputation research, etc.  
**Important:** Remember that many websites need monetization to share content with users. The presence of Ads alone is  
not enough for **Lowest**.

##### 4.5.5 Suspected Malicious Behavior

It may be difficult to prove that a page causes harm without experiencing harm yourself. For this reason, you may use the  
**Lowest** rating if you strongly suspect a page is malicious or harmful even without having proof. Any of the following  
should be considered untrustworthy:  
● Pages or websites that you strongly suspect are scams (see these links for more information about Internet  
scams: Avoid Scams 1 , Avoid Scams 2 , Internet Fraud ).  
● Pages that ask for personal information without a legitimate reason (for example, pages that ask for name,  
birthdate, address, bank account, government ID number, etc.).  
● Pages that appear to “phish” for passwords to Facebook, Gmail, or other popular online services. See here for  
information about “phishing” fraud.  
● Pages with links that you strongly suspect are malware downloads.  
**Important** : Do not continue to interact with the page if you observe these characteristics.  
If you do click on a link and encounter a malware warning from your browser or antivirus software ( example ), please do  
not continue to that page. You can assume that the page is malicious for the purpose of rating and use **Lowest**.  
Note that not all warnings your browser may display are related to malware (e.g., other types of browser warnings include  
certificate acceptance requests, content filtering warnings, etc.). If you are unsure or hesitant to continue to the page for  
any reason, you can release the task.

#### 4.6 Spammy Webpages

Pages and websites should exist for the benefit of people who visit the website. There are many types of webpages that  
can benefit visitors, such as online shopping or banking services, videos offering entertainment, or personal pages sharing  
a perspective or experience. Some of these pages depend on advertising and monetization to maintain the website and  
create high quality content while still benefiting visitors.  
However, some pages are created to benefit the website owner or other organizations and with little to no attention paid to  
the experience of the people who visit. When such pages use deceptive techniques to appear near the top of search  
results, it may disincentivize the creation of high quality content by crowding out pages created with effort, originality,  
talent, or skill that is helpful for visitors.  
This section describes characteristics of spam or spam-like pages that should be rated **Lowest**. The Google Search Web  
Spam Policies page is a good reference to learn more about different spam techniques. If you recognize any of these  
spam techniques on a page, please use the **Lowest** rating.  
You do not need to develop expertise to recognize all types of spam techniques described in the Google Search Web  
Spam Policies. However, with practice, we do expect you to recognize the techniques described in this section.

##### 4.6.1 Cannot Determine a Purpose, No MC, Little MC, Lowest Quality MC or No Added Value MC

All pages should be created with sufficient MC quality so that the page can achieve its purpose. However, some pages  
are so lacking in MC that the purpose of the page itself is unclear or you may suspect the page is not actually created for  
people.  
If any of the following are true, the page should be rated **Lowest** :  
● Despite your best efforts, the purpose of the page cannot truly be understood because the MC is gibberish or  
otherwise unusable for people  
● The page deliberately has no MC  
● The page is deliberately created with so little MC that it fails to achieve any purpose  
● The page is deliberately created with such low quality MC that it fails to achieve any purpose  
● The MC is created with little to no effort, has no originality and the MC adds no value compared to similar pages  
on the web

##### 4.6.2 Hacked, Defaced, or Spammed Pages

A hacked or defaced website is a site that has been modified without permission from the website owner(s).  
Websites can become hacked, defaced, or filled with a large amount of distracting and unhelpful content from bad actors.  
Bad actors may add unrelated MC or SC or may modify existing MC on webpages to change the purpose of the page.  
These pages should be rated **Lowest** because they fail to achieve their original purpose. Responsible website owners  
should regularly check their websites for suspicious behavior and take steps to protect users.  
A common problem on forum pages or in the comments sections of pages is "spammed" comments: posts with unrelated  
comments that are not intended to help other people, but rather to advertise a product or create a link to a website.  
Frequently these comments are posted by a “bot” rather than a real person. If a specific page on a website has many  
unrelated “spammed” comments, the page should be rated **Lowest**.  
See the Google Search Essentials Hacked Content Policy for more information.

##### 4.6.3 Expired Domain Abuse

Expired domain abuse is where an expired domain name is purchased and repurposed primarily to benefit the new  
website owner by hosting content that provides little to no value to users.  
Often the expired domain was a highly trusted site such as a government website, a charity, or a school with a trustworthy  
looking URL. The new website owner hopes to rank well using the reputation of the expired domain. The new content is  
often highly monetized or otherwise benefits the owner of the website. Visitors to the website may be confused by the  
new content, expecting to find a trustworthy government website, charity, etc.  
Here are some examples:  
● Affiliate content on a site previously used by a government agency  
● Commercial medical products being sold on a site previously used by a non-profit medical charity  
● Casino-related content on a former elementary school site  
How can you tell if a page is abusing an expired domain? Sometimes the URL or other aspects of the website offers a  
clue. For example, the URL may look like an elementary school website but the current content is on a topic that you  
would not expect from an elementary school such as payday loans or gambling. To confirm, look up the homepage or  
other pages of the website on the Internet Archive to see if an obvious change has occurred.

##### 4.6.4 Site Reputation Abuse

Site reputation abuse is a tactic where third-party content is published on a host site mainly because of that host's  
already-established ranking signals, which it has earned primarily from its first-party content. The goal of this tactic is for  
the content to rank better than it could otherwise on its own.  
Third-party content is content that's created by an entity that's separate from the established host site. Examples of  
separate entities include users of that site, freelancers, white-label services, and content created by people not employed  
directly by the host site.  
Having third-party content alone isn't site reputation abuse; it's only site reputation abuse if the third-party content is  
published on a host site mainly because of that host site's already-established ranking signals.  
Examples of site reputation abuse include, but are not limited to:  
● An educational site hosting a page about sponsored reviews of payday loans written by a third-party that  
distributes the same page to other sites across the web  
● A medical site hosting a third-party advertising page about "best casinos" that readers wouldn’t expect and that’s  
being placed on the site to rank better due to the established site’s ranking signals  
● A movie review site hosting third-party pages about topics that would be confusing to users to find on a movie  
review site (such as "ways to buy followers on social media sites", the "best fortune teller sites", and the "best  
essay writing services")  
● A news site hosting coupons provided by a white-label service where the main reason for publishing the coupons  
on the news site is to capitalize on the news site's reputation  
● An established first party site branches out into a new area primarily using freelance content because this content  
will rank better on the first-party site than it would have otherwise  
Examples that are **NOT** considered site reputation abuse include:  
● Wire service or press release service sites  
● News publications that have syndicated news content from other news publications  
● Sites designed to allow user-generated content, such as a forum website or comment sections  
● Columns, opinion pieces, articles, and other work of an editorial nature  
● Third-party content (for example, "advertorial" or "native advertising" type pages) where the purpose is to share  
content directly to readers (such as through promotion within the publication itself), rather than hosting the content  
to manipulate search rankings  
● Using affiliate links throughout a page, with links treated appropriately , or embedding third-party ad units  
throughout a page  
● Coupons that are sourced directly from merchants and other businesses that serve consumers

##### 4.6.5 Scaled Content Abuse

Creating an abundance of content with little effort or originality with no editing or manual curation is often the defining  
attribute of spammy websites.  
Scaled content abuse is a spam practice described in the Google Search Web Spam Policies. Scaled content abuse  
occurs when many pages are generated for the purpose of primarily benefiting the website owner and not helping users.  
This practice is typically focused on creating large amounts of unoriginal content that provides little to no value for website  
visitors compared to other similar pages on the web, no matter how it's created.  
Examples of scaled content abuse include:  
● Using automated tools (generative AI or otherwise) as a low-effort way to produce many pages that add little-to-no  
value for website visitors as compared to other pages on the web on the same topic.  
● Scraping feeds, search results, or other content to generate many pages (including through automated  
transformations like synonymizing, translating, or other obfuscation techniques), where little value is provided to

##### Visitors

● Stitching or combining content from different web pages without adding value  
● Creating multiple sites with the intent of hiding the scaled nature of the content  
● Creating many pages where the content makes little or no sense to a reader but contains search keywords  
Pages and websites made up of content created at scale with no original content or added value for users, should be  
rated **Lowest** , no matter how they are created. Even if you are unsure of the method of creation, e.g. whether or not the  
page is created using generative AI tools, you should still use the **Lowest** rating when you strongly suspect scaled  
content abuse after looking at several pages on the website.  
**4.6.6 MC Created with Little to No Effort, Little to No Originality, and Little to No Added Value for Website Visitors**  
The **Lowest** rating applies if all or almost all of the MC on the page (including text, images, audio, videos, etc) is copied,  
paraphrased, embedded, auto or AI generated, or reposted from other sources with little to no effort, little to no originality,  
and little to no added value for visitors to the website. Such pages should be rated **Lowest** , even if the page assigns  
credit for the content to another source.  
As a reminder, there are many types of effort that people put into content creation, from directly creating the content on  
the page to building custom page functionality. The criteria "little to no effort" means little to no effort of any type. Please  
review the description of Effort in Section 3.2 Quality of the Main Content.  
The word “copied” refers to the practice of “scraping” content, or copying content from other non-affiliated websites without  
adding any original content or value to users (see here for more information on copied or scraped content). Any type of  
content may be copied: text, images, video, etc. Images may be slightly cropped or edited to avoid detection. People  
may alter videos as well, or even make a video of a screen playing video\!  
**Important** : Licensed or syndicated content should not be considered as “copied” (see here for more on web syndication).  
Examples of syndicated content in the U.S. include news articles by AP or Reuters.

Content on a webpage may be "paraphrased" from another source. We will consider MC to be paraphrased if it contains  
content that is unoriginal and exists on other pages, with different wording, organization or phrasing. People can  
paraphrase content manually by rewriting the content from other sources using different words. Automated tools can also  
be used to create paraphrased content by restating or summarizing the content on other pages.  
Sometimes content is "embedded" or included on the page from another source. There is nothing wrong with embedding  
content, but the **Lowest** rating applies if there is no significant original content or added value on the page.  
Social media posts may be reposted by an unrelated account. There is nothing wrong with reposting content, but the  
**Lowest** rating applies if there is no added value in the form of additional content, context, or discussion.  
All of the following are considered copied or paraphrased content:  
● **Content copied, reposted, or embedded exactly from an identifiable source.** Sometimes an entire page is  
copied, and sometimes just parts of the page are copied. Sometimes multiple pages are copied and then pasted  
together into a single page. Content that has been copied, reposted, or embedded exactly is usually the easiest  
type of copied content to identify.  
● **Content that is copied, but changed slightly from the original.** This type of copying makes it difficult to find  
the exact matching original source. Sometimes just a few words are changed, or whole sentences are changed,  
or a “find and replace” modification is made, where one word is replaced with another throughout the text.  
Images may be cropped or videos may be segmented into shorter clips. These types of changes are deliberately  
done to make it difficult to find the original source of the content. We call this kind of content “copied with minimal  
alteration.”  
● **Content copied from a changing source, such as a search results page or news feed.** You often won't be  
able to find an exact matching original source if it is a copy of “dynamic” content (content that changes frequently).  
However, we will still consider this to be copied content.  
**● Content that is paraphrased from a single source or multiple sources.** Content from a single page or from  
many websites can be summarized, reworded or paraphrased by people or generative AI tools. Paraphrasing  
may be valuable, for example when an expert paraphrases the contents of a government policy in  
easy-to-understand language.  
**Important** : Copying, paraphrasing, embedding or reposting content does not automatically make a page **Lowest** quality.  
However, the **Lowest** rating is required when all or almost all of the MC on the page (including text, images, audio,  
videos, etc) is copied, paraphrased, embedded, or reposted with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no  
added value for website visitors. Likewise, the use of Generative AI tools alone does not determine the level of effort or  
Page Quality rating. Generative AI tools may be used for high quality and low quality content creation. For example, a  
high level of effort may be involved in creating high quality original artwork using Generative AI tools. However, it's also  
possible to use Generative AI tools to create **Lowest** quality content with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to  
no added value for website visitors.

##### 4.6.7 How to Determine if Content is Copied

How do you determine whether all or most of the MC is copied? How do you identify the original source of the content?  
How do you know if content is paraphrased from a single page or from multiple pages? These things can be difficult to  
determine, but the following steps may help.

1. Copy a sentence or phrase in the text. It may be necessary to try a few sentences or phrases from the page just  
   to be sure. When deciding what sentence or phrase to copy, try to find a sentence or series of several words  
   without punctuation, unusual characters, or suspicious words that may have replaced the original text.  
2. Search on Google by pasting the sentence or phrase (surrounded by quotation marks to search for an exact  
   match) inside the Google search box. You may also try without quotation marks to search for more general  
   matches.

Here are some sentences and phrases from this page about “The Wizard of Oz” film and how to search for  
them.  
Sentence or Phrase From a Sentence Query to Find the Sentence or Phrase  
A sentence on the page:  
All are convinced by Dorothy that the Wizard can help them  
too  
Try the query both with and without quotation marks around  
the sentence:  
\[ “ All are convinced by Dorothy that the Wizard can help  
them too ” \]  
\[ All are convinced by Dorothy that the Wizard can help  
them too \]  
A phrase on the page:  
Dorothy uses the Golden Cap to summon the Winged  
Monkeys  
Try the query both with and without quotation marks around  
the sentence:  
\[ “ Dorothy uses the Golden Cap to summon the Winged  
Monkeys ” \]  
\[ Dorothy uses the Golden Cap to summon the Winged  
Monkeys \]  
A different phrase on the page:  
revealing an old man who had journeyed to Oz from Omaha  
long ago in a hot air balloon  
Try the query both with and without quotation marks around  
the sentence:  
\[ “ revealing an old man who had journeyed to Oz from  
Omaha long ago in a hot air balloon ” \]  
\[ revealing an old man who had journeyed to Oz from  
Omaha long ago in a hot air balloon \]

3. Compare the pages you find that match the sentence or phrase. Is most of their MC the same? If so, does one  
   clearly come from a highly authoritative source that is known for original content creation (newspaper, magazine,  
   medical foundation, etc.)? Does one source seem to reasonably be the original? Does one source appear to  
   have the earliest publication date, verified by sources like the Wayback Machine?  
   Based on this older version of a Wikipedia article about “The Wizard of Oz,” which can be found using the Internet Archive  
   Wayback Machine , we can confirm that the text in the table has been copied. Please note that searching for the above  
   sentence and phrases will not lead you to a current Wikipedia article about “The Wizard of Oz,” which demonstrates how  
   confirming that the MC of a page contains copied content can sometimes be difficult.  
   Paraphrased content can be much harder to recognize. Use the same process described above to search for other pages  
   with similar content by searching for sentences from the page or searching for the page title. Paraphrased content is  
   likely to:  
   ● Only contain commonly known information or generally known facts  
   ● Have high overlap with webpages on well established sources such as Wikipedia, reference websites, etc.  
   ● Appear to summarize a specific page such as a forum discussion or news article without any added value  
   ● Have words or other indications of summarizing or paraphrasing generative AI tools, such as words like "As an AI  
   language model" ( example )

Use your best judgment. Sometimes it is clear that the content is copied or paraphrased from somewhere, but you cannot  
tell what the original source is. Other times the content found on the original source has changed enough that searches  
for sentences or phrases may no longer match the original source. For example, Wikipedia articles can change  
dramatically over time. Text copied from old copies may not match the current content. Summaries or paraphrased  
content may have a different organizational structure than the original source. If you strongly suspect the page you are  
evaluating is not the original source, consider it likely to be copied or paraphrased.  
**Important** : If all or almost all of the MC on the page (including text, images or videos) is copied, paraphrased, embedded,  
or reposted from other sources, you must assess the level of effort, originality and added value for website visitors in order  
to assign a rating. The **Lowest** rating is appropriate if there is little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added  
value for website visitors. The **Low** rating is appropriate if there is low effort, originality or added value to website visitors.

  ● Poisonous snakes exist  
  It is unlikely a human author would make these  
  odd statements and obvious mistakes. It's  
  likely this content was auto-generated with no  
  human editing.  
  No matter how this content was created, the  
  odd statements and factual inaccuracies make  
  this article untrustworthy and therefore Lowest  
  E-E-A-T and Lowest quality.

**Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation**  
Lowest: Lowest E-E-A-T and  
Deceptive  
**Untrustworthy**  
● This page has a deceptive purpose: the  
page claims to be an informational  
resource for parents, but the website  
terms of service state that it is published  
for AI enthusiasts and is not intended for  
the general public.  
● The website terms of use states that  
"some articles" are generated by artificial  
intelligence and may have errors or be  
out of date; there is no indication to  
which pages this statement applies. The  
information in this article is not  
trustworthy and is Lowest E-E-A-T  
The page appears to be an informational  
article about switching babies from breast milk  
to whole milk.  
The bottom of the page states "Our blog is  
dedicated to all things related to kids and  
parenting – including product reviews, news,  
recipes, and more. We strive to provide  
parents with the information they need in order  
to make informed decisions for their families."  
However, if you read the terms of service  
page, you'll find a very different description of  
pages on the website.  
The terms of use page states "Some articles  
on this website might have been partially  
generated by an artificial intelligence language  
model and published for experimental and  
research purposes. The articles on this  
website are only to be used as proof of

Given the statements above, the articles on  
this website should be considered  
untrustworthy and Lowest E-E-A-T.  
Lowest: Superiority of Specified  
Group 1

evidence  
Unsubstantiated claims about a Specified  
Group significantly harms members of that  
group and society as a whole. This page is on  
a YMYL topic.  
The purpose of the page is to promote the  
view of superiority of a group of people.  
This page makes unsubstantiated claims  
about the role of melanin in the human body.  
Lowest: Non-medical drug use  
advice  
This post encourages mixing an  
anti-anxiety drug with a  
recreational drug.

medical treatment significantly impact a  
person’s health. This is a YMYL topic.  
This post encourages harmful behavior.  
"Proana" or pro-anorexia is a movement to  
view anorexia as a lifestyle choice, not a  
disease. Proana and similar "thinspiration"  
pages contradict well-established expert  
consensus that anorexia is a life-threatening  
eating disorder.  
Lowest: Personal information  
collection scam  
Superficially, this looks like a  
payment page on a merchant  
site.  
However, the form asks for highly  
sensitive personal information  
such as social security number,  
drivers license number, bank  
account numbers, and ATM PIN.  
**Harmful to Self or Other Individuals,**  
**Untrustworthy**

financial harm to self or others  
● Characteristics of scams, malicious  
downloads, or other harmful behavior  
Sharing highly sensitive personal information  
could significantly impact a person’s financial  
security. This page is on a YMYL topic.  
While this looks like a merchant site, the true  
purpose of this page is to collect information  
that could be used to commit identity theft or  
remove money from someone's bank account.

downloads, or other harmful behavior  
Debt management significantly impacts a  
person’s financial security. This is a YMYL  
topic.

characteristics. From the MC, it is evident that  
the content creator lacks financial expertise  
(inconsistent with well-established expert  
consensus on what to do for debt relief).  
Furthermore, the page appears to be designed  
to manipulate people into clicking one of  
several prominent links rather than helping  
people by providing sound financial advice.  
The promise of debt relief is a common form of  
manipulation and scam technique.  
Lowest: Miley Cyrus is dead  
"news article" on a deceptive  
website  
This is a factually inaccurate  
article on a website called "Now  
8 News". It falsely claims Miley  
Cyrus is dead.

● Contains clearly inaccurate information  
that can be refuted by straightforward  
and widely accepted facts  
● Deceptive page design  
This website is designed to look like a news  
site and yet has deliberate factually inaccurate  
information. There is no information on who is  
responsible for this content. There is no date  
for the news article or date of death, which  
would be a key part of any standard reporting.  
This page was designed to misinform or  
deceive.  
Lowest: Crystals heal cancer

that can be refuted by straightforward  
and widely accepted facts  
● Contains information that contradicts  
well-established expert consensus  
Claims contradicting well-established scientific  
consensus about the shape of the earth  
undermine trust in scientific institutions such  
as NOAA, the agency responsible for issuing  
alerts during dangerous weather events. This  
is a YMYL topic.  
The purpose of this website is promoting  
misleading information. It is harmful to people  
and society as it undermines trust in public  
institutions.  
Lowest: Dry socket medical info  
This YMYL medical site has  
literally no information about who  
is responsible for the content or  
the website.  
**Untrustworthy**  
● Inadequate information about the  
website or content creator for the  
purpose of the page  
Medical information about this dental condition  
could significantly impact how people seek  
dental treatment. This page is on a YMYL  
topic.  
There is no information about who created this  
website, no contact information, and no  
information about the author.  
Medical pages require a high level of user  
trust. Because there is no information about  
who owns this website and who created this  
content, this is considered an untrustworthy  
website.  
Lowest: Merchant with little  
contact info, untrustworthy  
characteristics  
This looks like a product listing  
page on a merchant website.

● Inadequate information about the  
website or content creator for the  
purpose of the page  
● Characteristics of scams, malicious  
downloads, or other harmful behavior  
Inaccurate information about shipping and  
returns, deceptive use of logos and no  
information about who is responsible make this  
shopping site appear potentially fraudulent and  
untrustworthy.  
This page is selling Nike Air Jordan shoes.  
However, there is inadequate contact  
information on the contact us page for a  
merchant site.  
In addition, the Shipping and Returns page  
has the name of another company that seems  
to be unrelated. There are also official looking  
logos at the bottom of the homepage, including  
the Better Business Bureau logo and Google  
Checkout logo, that don’t appear to be  
affiliated with the website.

This poorly written article  
describes how to cure the  
stomach flu.  
**Harmfully Misleading Information,**

● Contains information that contradicts  
well-established expert consensus  
● Inadequate information about the  
website or content creator for the  
purpose of the page  
● Lowest E-E-A-T  
Many patient hospitalizations and deaths occur  
due to the flu each year. This topic could  
significantly impact a person’s health. This is a  
YMYL topic.  
The writing is poor and the information is not  
consistent with standard medical guidance. It  
is clear from the content the author does not  
have medical expertise.  
This page should not be trusted as a medical  
resource.  
Lowest: Pimple popping lowest

This very poorly written article  
describes popping pimples.  
**Untrustworthy**  
● Inadequate information about the  
website or content creator for the  
purpose of the page  
● Lowest E-E-A-T  
The writing is extremely poor and there is  
virtually no information in this article.  
For example, the opening sentence is  
"Popping pimples could be or could be not the  
new trend of getting rid of them."  
It is clear from the content that the author does  
not have skin care expertise.  
Lowest: Malicious merchant site

financial harm to self or others  
● Lowest E-E-A-T

This website swindled people and physically  
threatened people who complained. These  
articles on Wikipedia and the New York Times  
describe the deceptive techniques used by this  
website and provide other negative information  
about the website and its owner.  
The reputation of this website is lowest based  
on reports of malicious behavior.  
Lowest: Chicken recipes no MC  
This looks like a list of chicken  
recipes, but is actually a list of  
links that are ads.  
**Untrustworthy, Spammy**  
● No MC  
● Deceptive page design  
● Content created with little to no effort,  
little to no originality, and little to no  
added value for website visitors  
MC should be created to benefit people who  
come to the website. Pages without MC  
should be considered spammy as they crowd  
out and disincentivize the creation of pages  
with high quality MC.  
Pages with Ads that are designed to look like  
MC should be considered untrustworthy.

**Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation**  
Lowest: Mesothelioma deceptive

This page looks like a listing of  
resources about Mesothelioma, a  
form of lung cancer.  
**Untrustworthy, Spammy**  
● No MC  
● Deceptive page design  
● Content created with little to no effort,  
little to no originality, and little to no  
added value for website visitors  
Information about cancer could significantly  
impact how people make decisions related to  
medical treatment. This page is on a YMYL  
topic.  
This page is designed to look like a directory  
page or a list of helpful resources, but every  
link is an Ad. There is no MC on this page.  
Pages without MC should be considered  
spammy as they crowd out and disincentivize  
the creation of pages with high quality MC.  
Pages that disguise Ads as directory listings or  
other MC should be considered untrustworthy.  
Lowest: Ads deliberately obscure  
MC  
When you first visit the page, it  
appears that there is no MC, only  
Ads. If you scroll down, you will  
eventually find the MC at the  
bottom.  
**Untrustworthy**  
● Deliberately obstructed or obscured MC  
This page requires scrolling past so many Ads  
to get to the MC that many people may stop  
scrolling and leave the page before reaching  
the MC.  
Deliberately obscured MC to benefit the  
website with no help for people visiting the  
page should be considered untrustworthy.  
Lowest: Deceptive and  
untrustworthy fake survey page  
This page appears to be a  
survey with the opportunity to win  
an Apple MacBook Air, an  
iPhone 5c, or a Galaxy S4.  
**Untrustworthy, Spammy**  
● Inadequate information about the  
website or content creator for the  
purpose of the page  
● Deceptive page design  
● Characteristics of scams, malicious  
downloads, or other harmful behavior  
● Content created with little to no effort,  
little to no originality, and little to no  
added value for website visitors  
This page contains a fake survey, which  
appears to promise users the opportunity to  
win an Apple MacBook Air, an iPhone 5c, or a  
Galaxy S4.  
However, there is no information about who is  
responsible for the survey, even though upon  
clicking, the survey asks for highly personal  
information such as bank account numbers.  
The message at the top of the page, “Thank  
You from Goggle.com” and survey content  
could mislead users to think that the survey is  
affiliated with Google.  
This page is deceptive and should be  
considered untrustworthy.

**Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation**  
Lowest: Lowest MC free credit  
report  
The title of the page suggests  
that it may provide a credit report  
from the government  
"freecreditreport gov".  
However, the page has gibberish  
MC and spammy looking  
features, such as ads or links  
surrounding the meaningless  
text.  
**Untrustworthy, Spammy**  
● Extremely misleading title  
● Inadequate information about the  
website or content creator for the  
purpose of the page  
● Deceptive page design  
● Characteristics of scams, malicious  
downloads, or other harmful behavior  
● Cannot determine any purpose, e.g.,  
gibberish MC  
● Content created with little to no effort,  
little to no originality, and little to no  
added value for website visitors  
Credit reports could significantly impact one’s  
financial security. This is a YMYL topic.  
The MC is gibberish. There is no beneficial  
purpose of gibberish MC. The title of the page  
is misleading, given the MC.  
This page also has deceptive features in the  
supplementary content, such as a friend  
request, a prize alert, and a download button.  
It is highly likely that these are ads or  
malicious download links.  
Lowest: Buy Xanax  
This is a page on the website for  
the U.S. Green Building Council.  
However, this page has the  
words "Buy Xanax" over and  
over again, along with related  
words about buying Xanax and a  
URL link.  
**Untrustworthy, Spammy**  
● Characteristics of scams, malicious  
downloads, or other harmful behavior  
● Content created with little to no effort,  
little to no originality, and little to no  
added value for website visitors  
Prescription drugs could significantly impact a  
person’s health. This is a YMYL topic.  
This specific page has been created or  
modified on this organization's website in  
hopes that people will click on the link to buy  
the prescription drug Xanax.  
This is a spam technique. Spammers hope  
that the page will rank well in search results  
because the website is otherwise high quality.  
The words "buy xanax" are used repeatedly in  
hopes that the page will show up for the  
search "buy xanax".  
Attempting to spam search engines and trick  
people into clicking on links is highly  
untrustworthy behavior.

**Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation**  
Lowest: Auto-generated car  
engine code  
This page is full of  
supplementary content, links,  
and large ads.  
The MC at the top gives  
information about a specific error  
code P2570 and a second block  
of main content in the middle  
shows more information about  
P2570.  
The MC is broken up by large  
ads and it is difficult to  
understand due to the poor  
content quality.  
**Untrustworthy, Spammy**  
● Inadequate information about the  
website or content creator for the  
purpose of the page  
● Content created with little to no effort,  
little to no originality, and little to no  
added value for website visitors  
This page has low quality MC and spammy  
attributes.  
The page repeats the error code "P2570"  
beyond what is helpful for users- a technique  
known as irrelevant keywords.  
The small amount of MC is not original to the  
website. Lists of error codes are available  
either by purchase or by scraping.  
An important fact is missing at the top "When  
you check engine light came on code P2570  
the reason should be ." The reason is left out \-  
this should be the most important content on  
the page\!  
Looking at other pages on the website, it is  
clear that each page is created automatically  
by filling in a template from a list of error code  
information. There appears to be little to no  
manual editing or checking to make sure the  
error code content is correctly pulled in, as  
evident by the missing reason on this page.  
As with many spammy websites, there is no  
information about who is responsible for this  
website and no way to report problems with  
the page.

website or content creator for the

● Deceptive page design  
● Content created with little to no effort,  
little to no originality, and little to no  
added value for website visitors  
The MC on this page is copied with little or no  
time, effort, expertise, manual curation, or  
added value for users.  
Looking at the content at the bottom of the  
page and exploring other pages on the  
website, it is clear that each page is created  
automatically using content from Amazon and  
substituting different product names into a  
generic template. There appears to be little to  
no manual editing or curation on this page.  
The true purpose of this page is to bring users  
seeking information about products to this  
website in hopes that they will click and order  
products by clicking on Amazon affiliate links.  
This website does not have a beneficial  
purpose for users but rather was created to  
benefit the creator of the website. Though the  
website discloses that they use affiliate links,  
the site offers no added value for users.  
As with many deceptive websites, there is no  
information about who is responsible for this  
website.  
Lowest: Viagra copied content  
This looks like an information  
website for the drug Viagra.  
**Untrustworthy, Spammy**  
● Inadequate information about the

● Deceptive page design  
● Content created with little to no effort,  
little to no originality, and little to no

Information about prescription drugs could  
significantly impact a person’s health. This  
page is on a YMYL topic.  
All MC on this page is copied with little or no  
time, effort, expertise, manual curation, or  
added value for users. Here is the original  
source.  
Exploration of the pages on this website are  
similarly created with little expertise or added  
value for users.  
The true purpose of this page is to bring users  
seeking information about Viagra to this  
website in hopes that they will click on the  
“order now” link. The "order now" link goes to  
another website and is likely monetized.  
Therefore, this website does not have a  
beneficial purpose for users but rather was  
created to benefit another website.  
As with many deceptive websites, there is no  
information about who is responsible for this  
website.

Lowest: Scaled content abuse

**Spammy**  
● Scaled content abuse  
● All of the MC on the page (including text,  
images or videos) is paraphrased with  
little to no effort, little to no originality, and  
little to no added value for website  
visitors  
This page is a YMYL medical article.  
The contents of the page show it is created  
with generative AI with likely no original  
content and provides no value to users. For  
example, the article starts with "As a language  
model, I don’t have real-time data and my  
knowledge cutoff date is September 2021\.  
Cancer rankings.." The end of the text of the  
article appears to be cut off with an incomplete  
sentence "Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors  
(NETs): Pancreatic NETs are a rare type of  
pancreatic cancer that can have a poor"  
This is spam (scaled content abuse) and a  
highly untrustworthy medical page: it  
demonstrates no real expertise and may not  
be correct and is especially concerning for  
YMYL topics.  
Lowest: Scaled content abuse  
tumors  
**Untrustworthy, Spammy**  
● Scaled content abuse  
● Deceptive information about the website  
purpose  
● All of the MC on the page (including text,  
images or videos) is paraphrased or  
embedded with little to no effort, little to  
no originality, and little to no added value  
for website visitors  
Website information indicates this is a website  
for rabbit enthusiasts "We are rabbit lovers and  
breeders, we will share some of our guides  
here, welcome to discuss with us."  
However the website includes articles on a  
very wide variety of topics unrelated to rabbits  
such as YMYL human health, making the  
information about the website appear  
deceptive.  
All the MC on the page is embedded from a  
different source or likely paraphrased and  
unoriginal. If you explore the site, you'll find  
hundreds of templated articles with unoriginal,  
paraphrased content and embedded videos.  
This is an example of scaled content abuse.  
While the method of content creation is  
unknown, the format of the articles (question  
and answer) is a common technique to create  
scaled content by collecting questions  
(available from sources such as Google  
Search's "People also ask" feature ) and  
answering the questions with unoriginal,  
paraphrased content (often using generative  
AI tools).

**Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation**  
Lowest: Expired domain abuse  
**Untrustworthy, Spammy**  
● Expired domain abuse  
● Highly misleading URL  
At the time of this example, the URL for this  
example was ruralschools.org. Previously  
ruralschools.org was owned by an  
organization called Organizations Concerned  
for Rural Education (OCRE). Using the  
Internet Archive , we can see what the page  
used to look like.  
Currently the content is about the Hong Kong  
lottery.  
People may be genuinely expecting a website  
about rural schools for this URL. Consider  
URLs to be misleading or deceptive when the  
URL looks like a high quality government  
agency, school, charity or otherwise trusted  
source but the content is low quality and  
completely unrelated, e.g. low quality content  
about medical products, loans, lottery tickets,  
gambling, etc.

**Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation**  
Lowest: Site reputation abuse  
**Untrustworthy, Spammy**  
● Site reputation abuse  
● Deceptive page content; untrustworthy  
due to conflict of interest  
This is an article published on a news website.  
The top of the page has a Sponsored Content  
banner.  
The page goes on to disclose:  
"Articles attributed to this byline are authored  
by paying advertisers. The editorial team did  
not contribute to these pieces, and the

represent those of the editorial staff. Refer to  
our partner statement to better understand the  
nature of the relationship.  
The sponsor retains responsibility for the  
content and holds the copyright to their

This page qualifies as site reputation abuse  
because the content on the page is produced  
by a third party (a supplement maker) and  
published on this news website to inherit the  
reputation of the news publisher, even though  
the new publisher is not responsible for this  
content.  
In addition to site reputation abuse, there are  
also potentially misleading and untrustworthy  
aspects to this article that warrant a Lowest  
rating:  
● Even though there is a disclaimer, the  
content could be mistaken for an  
article written by the newspaper.  
● The article appears to be an  
independent review for a supplement,  
but is actually written by the producer  
of the supplement.  
● There is a clear conflict of interest,  
making this an untrustworthy source  
of information

**Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation**  
Lowest: Scaled content abuse  
chickens  
**Untrustworthy, Spammy**  
● Scaled content abuse  
● Deceptive information about the website  
purpose  
● Most or all of the MC on the page  
(including text, images or videos) is  
paraphrased or embedded with little to  
no effort, little to no originality, and little to  
no added value for website visitors  
● Repetitive, low value to no add MC  
The about us page describes the website as  
providing information for seniors: "we provide  
non-medical information to senior citizens in  
their own homes or apartments." However, the  
site hosts hundreds of articles on all sorts of  
topics.  
The articles are templated, have paraphrased  
text content and embedded videos from other  
sources. This is an example of Scaled Content  
Abuse.  
This page is titled with a poorly phrased  
question "How Cold Can Chickens Tolerate"  
The answer text is poorly written and starts off  
bizarrely: "What is this? Cold weather  
chickens..."  
The page goes on to have repetitive questions  
and poorly produced responses. "What temp  
is too cold for chickens?" "Is 40 degrees too  
cold for chickens?", etc.  
A careful read of the answers shows that the  
sentences may make sense individually, but  
not as a whole. For example "How cold can  
chickens tolerate at night? Chickens can  
survive quite well with temperatures down into  
the teens. In fact, if you place a thermometer  
in your coop overnight, you will likely find the  
temperature has been maintained in the thirty  
to forty-degree area." (The second sentence  
does not make sense following the first.)  
While the method of content creation is  
unknown, the format of the articles (question  
and answer) is commonly used to create low  
effort, unoriginal, paraphrased content with  
generative AI tools. The text does not appear  
to have been written or edited by a human  
editor.

### 5.0 Low Quality Pages

**Low** quality pages do not achieve their purpose well because they are lacking in an important dimension or have a  
problematic aspect. **Low** quality pages do not meet the standards for **Lowest** but may have similar though milder  
undesirable characteristics.  
To identify **Low** quality pages, start by considering the following:  
Initial Consideration **Low** Quality Pages  
The purpose of the page **Low** quality pages have a beneficial or non-harmful purpose.  
The potential for the page to cause harm as  
described in these guidelines  
**Low** quality pages have either no potential to cause harm, or have  
some mild potential for harm but do not meet the standards for **Lowest**  
as described in Section 4.0.  
The topic of the page, the type of website, and  
the extent to which YMYL standards apply  
A page on any topic or any type of website may qualify for **Low.**  
Give special scrutiny to pages or websites needing a high level of  
trust, such as online stores, medical websites, or news coverage of  
major civic issues.  
Next, assess the page to determine if any of the criteria for **Low** apply:  
**Low** Page Quality Assessment Any one of the following is justification for **Low**  
Quality of the MC MC is created without adequate effort, originality, talent, or skill  
necessary to achieve the purpose of the page in a satisfying way.  
The title of the page The page title is slightly misleading, shocking, or exaggerated.  
The role of Ads and SC on the page The Ads or SC significantly distract from or interrupt the use of the MC  
as described in Section 5.3.  
Information provided by the website and  
content creator  
Unsatisfying amount of website information or information about the  
content creator for the purpose of the page.  
**Important** : For personal content shared on social media platforms or  
forums, an alias or username is adequate.  
Reputation of the website and content creator A mildly negative reputation of the website or content creator.  
Trustworthiness of the page: E-E-A-T Inadequate level of E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page.  
**Important** : Low quality pages can occur on any type of website, including academic websites, nonprofit websites,  
government websites, or any other generally helpful type of website. Low quality pages may be about any topic. Pages  
on YMYL topics need more scrutiny for signs of Low quality related to the MC and website/content creator because the  
page could impact a person’s health, financial stability, or safety, or the welfare or well-being of society. However, for any  
type of page, a single Low quality attribute is enough to use the **Low** quality rating.

#### 5.1 Lacking E-E-A-T

**Low** quality pages often lack an appropriate level of E-E-A-T for the topic or purpose of the page. Here are some  
examples:  
● The content creator lacks adequate experience, e.g. a restaurant review written by someone who has never eaten  
at the restaurant  
● The content creator lacks adequate expertise, e.g. an article about how to skydive written by someone with no  
expertise in the subject  
● The website or content creator is not an authoritative or trustworthy source for the topic of the page, e.g. tax form  
downloads provided on a cooking website.  
● The page or website is not trustworthy for its purpose, e.g. a shopping page with minimal customer service  
information  
**Important:** The **Low** rating should be used if the page lacks appropriate E-E-A-T for its purpose. No other considerations  
such as positive reputation or the type of website can overcome a lack of E-E-A-T for the topic or purpose of the page.

#### 5.2 Low Quality Main Content

MC is **Low** quality if it is created without adequate effort, originality, talent, or skill necessary to achieve the purpose of the  
page in a satisfying way. Mild inaccuracies on informational pages are evidence of **Low** quality. However, if the page has  
harmful inaccuracies or so many inaccuracies that it feels untrustworthy, the **Lowest** rating is justified.  
Here are some examples of pages with **Low** quality MC:  
**Low Quality MC Examples Why the MC is considered Low quality**  
A crafting tutorial page with instructions on how to make a  
basic craft and lots of unhelpful "filler" at the top, such as  
commonly known facts about the supplies needed or other  
non-crafting information.  
Lacks adequate effort to clearly present the instructions to  
people hoping to make the craft.  
A list of the best vacuum cleaners with product images  
and reviews that are paraphrased or summarized from  
other sources, with minimal signs of effort or original  
content added by the content creator.  
Lacks adequate effort and first-hand experience from the  
content creator.  
A slide show of the top 10 world destinations using other  
people's pictures and existing top 10 lists.  
Lacks effort and originality.  
A page titled "How many centimeters are in a meter?" with  
a large amount of off-topic and unhelpful content such that  
the very small amount of helpful information is hard to find.  
Lacks effort, has excessive filler, lacks depth, and has only  
commonly known facts.  
A list of the tallest mountains in the world that is missing  
Mount Everest.  
Lacks accuracy and effort.  
The title of the page is also considered part of the MC. Titles are important because they represent the page in search  
results and help users decide what to click on. A misleading title can lead to a poor search experience. Exaggerated or  
shocking titles are evidence of **Low** quality because of the poor user experience that results when users see the actual  
MC after reaching the page.

Here are some examples of pages with **Low** quality titles:  
**Low Quality Title Examples Why the Title is considered Low quality**  
A page titled "Pink Elephant: Part 2 coming soon\!", but  
includes only speculation and rumor about a potential  
movie sequel that may or may not be produced.  
Slightly misleading title would give people the impression  
that the movie sequel has a confirmed release date, and  
that the page would provide accurate information about it.  
A page titled "Is the World about to End? Mysterious  
Sightings of Sea Serpents Prompt Panic\!", for an article  
about the remains of a dead fish on a beach.  
Exaggerated and shocking title is a mismatch with the  
content of the article.  
A page titled "Eat the Healthiest Foods in the WORLD to  
extend your life\!\!\!\!" for a list of tips on how to add more  
fruits and vegetables to meals.  
Overly exaggerated title suggests that the page would  
offer something more than the basic nutrition advice it  
provides.  
The level of talent or skill required for artistic expression by ordinary people on social media or other websites that allow  
content sharing should be viewed leniently. In many cases, people post activities to share with friends, such as a video  
documenting a first attempt at a new hobby. These types of pages should not be considered **Low** on the basis of talent or  
skill because the primary purpose is sharing content. Use the **Low** rating only if the lack of talent or skill prevents the  
page from achieving its purpose well.  
**Important** : **Low** quality MC does not meet the standard for **Lowest** and is not harmful, but it is unsatisfying for the  
purpose of the page or causes the page to fail to achieve its purpose well.

##### 5.2.1 MC is Created with Low Effort, Low Originality and Low Added Value for Website Visitors

People who search benefit from a variety of websites offering high quality content and good experiences to website  
visitors. However, some webpages are created by "repackaging" content available on higher quality sites, with low effort,  
low originality and low added value for website visitors compared to higher quality sources.  
As a reminder, the **Lowest** rating applies if all or almost all of the MC on the page (including text, images or videos) is  
copied, paraphrased, embedded, or reposted from other sources with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no  
added value for website visitors. However, the **Low** rating should be used if much of the MC on the page is copied,  
paraphrased, embedded or reposted, with a low amount of effort to create value by editing, manually curating,  
reformatting or injecting some original content.  
Examples of low effort, low originality and low added value include  
● Social media reposts with little additional comment or discussion  
● Pages with content from other sources (e.g. pages of embedded videos or pages with "repinned" images) with  
little additional comment, discussion, or curation by the content creator of the page  
● "Best" lists based on existing reviews and lists with little original content  
The **Low** rating applies when the MC is created using any technique with low effort, low originality, and low added value  
for website visitors compared to other pages that contain similar content.

##### 5.2.2 Filler as a Poor User Experience

The main content (MC) of a page should support its purpose. Web site owners and content creators should place the  
most helpful and essential MC near the top of the page so that visitors can immediately access it.  
A high quality page has the most helpful MC placed most prominently. Content that supports the page purpose without  
directly contributing to the primary goal can be included, but it should be shown lower on the page in a less prominent  
position. For example, on recipe pages, the recipe itself and important supporting content directly related to the recipe  
should be prominently displayed near the top of the webpage.  
Sometimes, MC includes "filler" \- low-effort content that adds little value and doesn't directly support the purpose of the  
page. Filler can artificially inflate content, creating a page that appears rich but lacks content website visitors find  
valuable. Filler can result in a poor experience for people who visit the page, especially if placed prominently ahead of  
helpful content for the purpose of the page.  
**Important** : Content that supports the page purpose without directly contributing to its primary goal can still be valuable if  
placed appropriately. Filler refers to low-effort content that occupies valuable and prominent space without providing  
value or without being helpful or satisfying for the primary purpose of the page.  
A Low rating is appropriate if the page  
● Contains a large amount of low quality and unhelpful filler, causing a poor experience for people visiting the page  
● Contains a large amount visually prominent filler that makes it difficult to find the helpful MC, causing frustration  
for people visiting the page

#### 5.3 Distracting Ads/SC

We expect Ads and SC to be visible. However, some Ads, SC, or interstitial pages (i.e., pages displayed before or after  
the content you are expecting) make it difficult to use the MC. Pages with Ads, SC, or other features that significantly  
distract from or make it difficult for the user to efficiently access the information they want from the page should typically  
be given a **Low** rating even if some of the MC is helpful.  
A single pop-over Ad or interstitial page with a clear and easy-to-use close button is not terribly distracting, even though it  
may annoy some people. However, difficult-to-close Ads that follow page scrolls, or interstitial pages that require an app  
download, can be truly distracting and make the MC difficult to use. You can see examples of interstitial pages here.  
The content of the Ads, SC, or other features may be distracting as well: sexually suggestive images such as here ,  
grotesque images such as here , and sexually suggestive Ads on otherwise non-sexual pages are very distracting.  
Finally, Ads and SC can be distracting if the titles or images of the Ads or SC are shocking or disturbing. Here is an  
example of a page with shocking and exaggerated titles, images, and text in the Ads and SC.  
**Important** : The **Low** rating should be used if the page has Ads, SC, or other features that significantly distract from or  
interrupt the use of the MC.

#### 5.4 Mildly Negative Reputation of the Website or Content Creator

The **Low** rating should be used if the website or the content creator has a mildly negative reputation.  
If the MC was created by a content creator who is using the website to host it, research the reputation of the content  
creator. Expect to find reputation information on well-known journalists, authors, social media influencers, bloggers and  
vloggers, professionals such as lawyers and doctors, etc. Pay attention when there is evidence of mildly  
negative—though not malicious or financially fraudulent—reputation. However, a lack of reputation information for  
ordinary people and lesser-known content creators is expected and is not a sign of **Low** quality.  
Exercise care when researching the reputation of businesses. Try to find enough reviews to understand a range of

customer opinions and experiences, and read the details of negative reviews and low ratings before inferring that the  
business overall has a negative reputation. A few negative customer service reviews are typical for businesses such as  
stores or restaurants.

#### 5.5 Unsatisfying Amount of Information about the Website or Content Creator

Expect to find some form of website information for many or most websites. We expect clear information about who (e.g.,  
what individual, company, business, foundation, etc.) created the MC, unless there is good reason for anonymity. A  
long-standing Internet alias or username can identify the content creator. For personal websites or forum discussions on  
non-YMYL topics, an email address or social media link alone may be sufficient. Many people are reasonably hesitant to  
share personally identifiable information online\!  
Stores and websites that process financial transactions require a high level of user trust. If a store or financial transaction  
website has just an email address and physical address, it may be difficult to get help if there are issues with the  
transaction. Likewise, many other types of websites on clear YMYL topics also require a high level of user trust.  
**Important** : Pages that offer payment functionality or process other types of financial transactions should receive a **Low**  
rating if there is an unsatisfying amount of customer service information or contact information. Pages on YMYL topics  
and other pages that require a high level of user trust should receive a **Low** rating if there is an unsatisfying amount of  
information about who is responsible for the website or who created the content. For forums, social media pages, and  
other websites where people commonly exchange opinions, a username is an acceptable identifier.

#### 5.6 Exaggerated or Mildly Misleading Information about the Website or Content Creator

Recall that deceptive information about a website or content creator is a strong reason for the **Lowest** rating.  
However, sometimes the information about the website or content provider seems exaggerated or mildly misleading, such  
as claims of personal experience or expertise that seem overstated or included just to impress website visitors. E-E-A-T  
assessments should be based on the MC itself, the information you find during reputation research, verifiable credentials,  
etc, not just website or content creator claims of "I'm an expert\!".  
If you find the information about the website or the content creator to be exaggerated or mildly misleading, the **Low** rating  
should be used.

#### 5.7 Examples of Low Quality Pages

Type of Webpage/Content Low Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation  
Low: News 1  
Article about nuclear power  
● Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the  
page: does not achieve the purpose well  
● MC lacks accuracy or does not align with  
well-established expert consensus  
● Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page  
Information about energy sources and nuclear  
power could significantly impact global  
industries and society. This is a YMYL topic.  
The writing of this article is unprofessional,  
including many grammar and punctuation  
errors. The MC also appears to have been  
paraphrased from a science article found on a  
different source, but with factual inaccuracies  
introduced throughout. The combination of low  
quality MC and lack of E-A-T justify the  
Lowest+ to Low rating.  
Low: News 2  
Article titled "Getting Rid Of  
Toxins After The Holiday Season"  
● Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the  
page: does not achieve the purpose well  
● MC lacks accuracy or does not align with  
well-established expert consensus  
● Slightly misleading, shocking, or  
exaggerated title  
● Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page  
The title of the article is misleading and does  
not reflect the actual content of the page. The  
MC does not explain how to get rid of toxins or  
what the word "toxins" in the headline refers to.  
The content also has many problems: the  
writing quality is poor, and the article includes  
meaningless statements such as "water  
therapy is one of the easiest ways of beauty  
regimen since it will give enough moisture on  
the skin". The article fails to cite sources, and  
there is no evidence of E-A-T.  
Low: Informational  
40th birthday party food ideas  
● Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the  
page: does not achieve the purpose well  
● Ads or SC significantly distract from or  
interrupt the use of MC  
● Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page  
This page and website have many  
characteristics of Low quality pages. Close  
observation shows MC that contains mostly  
commonly known information and poor quality  
writing, demonstrating a lack of effort. The MC  
is broken up by large Ads that significantly  
disrupt the user experience.  
Low: Article 1  
Article with tips for dressing for  
the office  
● Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the  
page: does not achieve the purpose well  
● Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page  
This informational article has multiple Low  
quality characteristics leading to a Low or  
Lowest+ rating. There is a large amount of  
"filler" or meaningless content and a complete  
lack of effort in editing. In addition, the MC  
contains only commonly known information with  
no expertise or first-hand experience shared by  
the content creator.

**Type of Webpage/Content Low Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation**  
Low: Article 2  
Using ginger for your health  
● Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the  
page: does not achieve the purpose well  
● MC lacks accuracy or does not align with  
well-established expert consensus  
● Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page  
This informational article has multiple Low  
quality characteristics leading to a Low or  
Lowest+ rating. There is garbled or  
meaningless content, a complete lack of effort  
in editing, and unrelated links in the middle of  
the page. Additionally, the article is on a health  
topic, and there are no signs that the content  
creator has relevant expertise or links to  
support the medical claims made in the article.  
Low: Article 3  
How to adopt children from Iraq  
● Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the  
page: does not achieve the purpose well  
● Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page  
Adopting a child significantly impacts the health  
and well-being of families. This is a YMYL  
topic.  
However, the steps listed here are merely  
commonly-known information that would be of  
little benefit to someone interested in adopting  
a child from Iraq. For example, step 1 says  
“Choose an adoption agency” and suggests  
looking in a phone book. This demonstrates a  
lack of effort in the creation of MC.  
There is almost no information specific to Iraq.  
There is no evidence of expertise on adoption  
from the description about the author.  
Note that some Ads have the same format as  
links to other articles on this website, potentially  
making it a bit harder for users to visually  
distinguish these Ads from the MC and SC.  
Low: Article 4  
● MC has low effort, low originality and little  
added value compared to the original  
source  
This page summarizes a discussion page.  
There is little original content. It requires low  
effort to summarize a discussion. This page  
offers little added value over the original  
source.

**Type of Webpage/Content Low Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation**  
Low: Financial  
Page with advice on picking a  
quality stock for investment  
● Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page  
Advice on stock investment could significantly  
impact a person’s financial decisions and  
security. This is a YMYL topic.  
The MC is superficial and includes mostly  
commonly known information for this topic, e.g.  
"look at key statistics" or "find companies with  
rising revenue". There is no evidence that the  
author has financial expertise. Because this  
article gives advice on a YMYL financial topic,  
lacking expertise is a reason for a Low rating.  
Low: Medical  
Page with information about how  
long the flu lasts  
● Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page  
Many patient hospitalizations and deaths occur  
due to the flu each year. This topic could  
significantly impact a person’s health. This is a  
YMYL topic.  
There is no evidence that the author has  
medical expertise. Because this article gives  
advice on a YMYL medical topic, lacking  
expertise is a reason for a Low rating.  
Low: Recipe 1  
Apple pie recipe  
● Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the  
page: does not achieve the purpose well  
This page and website have many  
characteristics of Low quality pages. The MC  
is low quality and lacks important information.  
For example, it gives no indication of how to  
make a crust and doesn’t list premade crust as  
an ingredient. It would be very difficult to  
actually make an apple pie using this recipe.  
This page is lacking the kind of helpful content  
we expect in recipe pages, such as user  
reviews or comments. Without such  
information, it’s hard to tell if the recipe is any  
good. The small pink text at the top is not  
helpful for users.  
Low: Recipe 2  
Gluten-free New York cheesecake  
recipe  
● Ads or SC significantly distract from or  
interrupt the use of MC  
This is an example of distracting and disruptive  
Ads/SC: there are large Ads in the main column  
pushing down the MC as well as highly  
distracting content on the right that are labeled  
“Top Posts & Pages.” It is unclear whether  
these are SC or Ads. Additionally, the images  
in the Ads/SC are shocking, racy, and  
completely unrelated to the MC, which creates  
a poor user experience.

**Type of Webpage/Content Low Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation**  
Low: Recipe 3  
● A large quantity of prominent filler makes  
it difficult to find the helpful MC  
● Ads, SC and Filler MC distract from the  
helpful MC  
The primary purpose of the page is to share a  
recipe for Butterbeer. While helpful MC such  
as the ingredients and information about  
Butterbear are at the top of the page,  
significant scrolling is required to find the  
actual Butterbeer recipe. The "jump to recipe"  
link itself is difficult to find.  
The page has a large amount of content  
unrelated to Butterbeer between the  
Butterbeer ingredients and the Butterbeer  
recipe. The page has photos and reviews of  
many other unrelated foods at universal  
studios. In addition, Ads and SC and  
interstitials appear throughout causing  
additional scrolling to finally find the recipe  
towards the bottom.  
All of the above lead to a poor user  
experience.  
Note: A higher rating could be appropriate if  
the page were better organized, the recipe  
was prominently placed and easy to find, and  
there was less Filler, SC and Ads distracting  
from the helpful MC.

### 6.0 Medium Quality Pages

**Medium** pages have a beneficial purpose and achieve their purpose. There is nothing wrong with **Medium** quality pages.  
Expect to encounter many **Medium** quality pages in PQ rating tasks.  
To identify **Medium** quality pages, start by considering the following:  
Initial Consideration **Medium** Quality Pages  
The purpose of the page **Medium** quality pages have a beneficial or non-harmful purpose.  
The potential for the page to cause harm as  
described in these guidelines  
**Medium** quality pages are not expected to cause harm.  
The topic of the page, the type of website, and  
the extent to which YMYL standards apply  
A page on any topic or any type of website may qualify for **Medium.**  
Give special scrutiny to pages on YMYL topics or websites needing a  
high level of trust, such as online stores.  
The title of the page **Medium** quality pages have titles that summarize the page.  
The role of Ads and SC on the page The Ads and SC do not block or significantly interfere with the MC on  
**Medium** quality pages.  
**Remember** : Many websites need monetization to share content with  
users. The presence or absence of Ads alone is not a consideration  
for PQ rating.  
Information provided by the website and  
content creator  
**Medium** quality pages have adequate information about the website  
and content creator for the purpose of the page. For stores or  
websites that process financial transactions, examine the customer  
service information.  
**Important:** For personal content shared on social media platforms or  
forums, an alias or username is adequate.  
Next, assess the page to determine if the criteria for **Medium** apply:  
**Medium** Page Quality Assessment **Medium** Quality Criteria  
Quality of the MC MC created with adequate effort, originality, talent, or skill such that the  
page achieves its purpose.  
Reputation of the website and content creator Not especially positive nor especially negative: Reputation information  
found about the website or content creator is not concerning, but not  
positive enough to justify a higher rating.  
Trustworthiness of the page: E-E-A-T Adequate level of E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page.

#### 6.1 Types of Medium Quality Pages

There are two types of **Medium** quality pages:  
Type of **Medium** Page **Description**  
**Nothing wrong, but nothing**  
**special**  
All of the **Medium** Page Quality considerations and criteria apply.  
**Mixed, but with some**  
**redeeming qualities**  
The page or website has some signs of **High** quality (E-E-A-T, quality of the MC,  
positive reputation), but also has one sign or mild signs of **Low** quality.  
**Important:** For a page to receive a rating higher than **Medium** , it must meet the criteria described in the next sections on  
**High** and **Highest** page quality. For a page to receive a rating lower than **Medium** , it must meet the criteria for **Low** or  
**Lowest** page quality. **Medium** is a rating that applies to many pages you will encounter in PQ rating tasks: many pages  
have nothing wrong, yet do not represent the high or highest quality content that's available online.

#### 6.2 Examples of Medium Quality Pages

Webpage/Type of Content Medium Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation

### 7.0 High Quality Pages

**High** quality pages serve a beneficial purpose and achieve that purpose well. **High** quality pages exist for almost any  
beneficial purpose you can imagine, from providing information to selling products to making people laugh to artistic  
expression.  
To identify **High** quality pages, start by considering the following:  
Initial Consideration **High** Quality Pages  
The purpose of the page **High** quality pages have a beneficial purpose.  
The potential for the page to cause harm as  
described in these guidelines  
**High** quality pages are not expected to cause harm.  
The topic of the page, the type of website, and  
the extent to which YMYL standards apply  
A page on any topic or any type of website may qualify for **High.**  
Give special scrutiny to pages on YMYL topics or websites needing a  
high level of trust, such as online stores.  
The title of the page **High** quality pages have titles that summarize the page.  
The role of Ads and SC on the page The Ads and SC do not block or significantly interfere with the MC on  
**High** quality pages.  
**Remember** : Many websites need monetization to share content with  
users. The presence or absence of Ads alone is not a consideration  
for PQ rating.  
Information provided by the website and  
content creator  
**High** quality pages have adequate information about the website and  
content creator for the purpose of the page. For stores or websites  
that process financial transactions, examine the customer service  
information.  
**Important:** For personal content shared on social media platforms or  
forums, an alias or username is adequate.  
Next, assess the page to determine if the criteria for **High** apply:  
**High** Page Quality Assessment **High** Quality Pages must demonstrate at least one of the following  
Quality of the MC MC created with a high level of effort, originality, talent, or skill such  
that the page achieves its purpose well.  
Reputation of the website and content creator Positive reputation of the website for the topic of the page.  
Positive reputation of the content creator for the topic of the MC.  
Trustworthiness of the page: E-E-A-T High level of E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page.

#### 7.1 High Quality Main Content

**High** quality MC should be satisfying for people visiting the page. High quality MC shows evidence of effort, originality,  
talent, or skill. For informational pages, High quality MC must be accurate and consistent with well-established expert  
consensus when such consensus exists. Have high standards\! If you aren't sure whether the content is high quality, try  
finding other pages on the same topic to help calibrate your assessment: "typical" and "average" pages on a topic  
generally have Medium (not High) quality MC.  
To help develop your standards, here are some examples of **High** quality MC in contrast with **Low** quality MC:  
**High Quality MC: Details and Examples Low Quality MC: Details and Examples**  
**High level of effort:** The website or content creators  
worked hard to create content that achieves the purpose  
of the page. The MC is well-organized, edited, and  
curated to support the purpose.  
● A news article with accuracy, depth, and clarity  
● A Q\&A page or forum post with meaningful  
discussion by multiple participants  
● A well-organized crafting tutorial page with clear,  
helpful instructions so that others can make the  
craft successfully  
**Low level of effort:** The MC shows signs of a lack of  
effort by the website or content creators.  
● Lack of curation or editing: Content that helps the  
page achieve its purpose is mixed with less helpful  
distracting or filler content  
● Lack of content creation: A forum post with little  
discussion or only superficial comments  
● Lack of organization: A crafting tutorial page with  
lots of unhelpful "filler" at the top and little effort put  
into explaining how to make the craft (the purpose  
of the page) at the bottom  
**High originality**  
● The MC is unique or original to the website  
● Original photos or video footage produced by the  
website or content creator  
● The content on the page is unique to the content  
creators, such as a personal perspective based on  
first-hand life experience  
**Low originality**  
● Information is summarized from other sources with  
little added value  
● Photos or videos come from other sources  
● A summary of the perspectives of others, such as  
summarizing product reviews written by others  
**High level of talent or skill**  
● The MC showcases the talent of the creator, e.g. a  
video of a talented content creator dancing  
● The MC allows the page to achieve its purpose well  
because the content creator has talent or skill, e.g.  
a how-to article on plumbing by a skilled plumber  
**Low level of talent or skill**  
● A lack of adequate talent or skill prevents the page  
from achieving its purpose, e.g. a how-to article on  
plumbing by someone who does not have the  
necessary skill to explain the steps accurately

#### 7.2 Positive Reputation

Positive reputation of the website can be a reason for a **High** rating if the website is responsible for the MC. If the website  
is not responsible for the MC (e.g., posts on social media websites or forums), positive reputation of the content creator(s)  
can be a reason for the **High** rating.  
For non-YMYL topics, reputation information may be less formal. Popularity, user engagement, and user reviews can be  
considered evidence of reputation for non-YMYL websites: websites can be considered to have a positive reputation if  
they are popular and well-known for their topic or content type.  
**Remember:** Many smaller websites and ordinary people have little reputation information available. A page can still  
receive a **High** rating without reputation information.

#### 7.3 High Level of E-E-A-T

Depending on the purpose of the page, topic, and type of website, a high level of E-E-A-T may be required for the page to  
achieve its purpose well and be considered **High** quality. Pages with **High** E-E-A-T are trustworthy or very trustworthy.  
**Experience** is valuable for almost any topic. Social media posts and forum discussions are often **High** quality  
when they involve people sharing their experience. From writing symphonies to reviewing home appliances,  
first-hand experience can make a social media post or discussion page **High** quality.  
**Expertise** is required for satisfying content on a variety of topics, from hobbies such as photography to YMYL  
topics such as tax preparation. Think about the topic of the page and what expertise is needed to create  
satisfying, trustworthy content. There are many types of informal expertise that may be visible in the MC itself.  
**Authoritative** pages of all types can be found. Government tax websites are an authoritative source for tax  
forms. Local businesses and organizations may be go-to sources for local information. When looking at a  
page or website, consider whether it is considered a go-to, authoritative source for the type of information it is  
displaying.  
**Trust** is especially important for **High** quality pages that involve processing financial transactions or cover  
YMYL topics. Even if the topic is not YMYL, trust may still be required; for example, product reviews and pages  
offering advice require at least some level of trust. While not all pages require a high level of trust, a  
trustworthy page is often a satisfying one.  
Think about the topic of the page. What kind of E-E-A-T is required for the page to achieve its purpose well?

### 8.0 Highest Quality Pages

**Highest** quality pages serve a beneficial purpose and achieve that purpose very well. The distinction between **High** and  
**Highest** is based on the quality of MC, the reputation of the website and content creator, and/or E-E-A-T.  
To identify **Highest** quality pages, start by considering the following:  
Initial Consideration **Highest** Quality Pages  
The purpose of the page **Highest** quality pages have a beneficial purpose.  
The potential for the page to cause harm as  
described in these guidelines  
**Highest** quality pages are not expected to cause harm.  
The topic of the page, the type of website, and  
the extent to which YMYL standards apply  
A page on any topic or any type of website may qualify for **Highest.**  
Give special scrutiny to pages on YMYL topics or websites needing a  
high level of trust, such as online stores.  
The title of the page **Highest** quality pages have titles that summarize the page.  
The role of Ads and SC on the page The Ads and SC do not block or significantly interfere with the MC on  
**Highest** quality pages.  
**Remember** : Many websites need monetization to share content with  
users. The presence or absence of Ads alone is not a consideration  
for PQ rating.  
Information provided by the website and  
content creator  
**Highest** quality pages have adequate information about the website  
and content creator for the purpose of the page. For stores or  
websites that process financial transactions, examine the customer  
service information.  
**Important:** For personal content shared on social media platforms or  
forums, an alias or username is adequate.  
Next, assess the page to determine if the criteria for **Highest** apply:  
**Highest** Page Quality Assessment **Highest** Quality Pages must demonstrate at least one of the following

such that the page achieves its purpose very well.

Very positive reputation of the content creator for the topic of the MC.  
Trustworthiness of the page: E-E-A-T Very high level of E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page.

#### 8.1 Very High Quality MC

Very high quality MC should be highly satisfying for people visiting the page. Very high quality MC shows evidence of a  
high level of effort, originality, talent, or skill. For informational pages, very high quality MC must be accurate, clearly  
communicated, and consistent with well-established expert consensus when it exists. Very high quality MC represents  
some of the most outstanding content on a topic or type that's available online.  
The standards for **Highest** quality MC may be very different depending on the purpose, topic, and type of website. Here  
are some examples of **Highest** quality original content:  
● **For news** : Original reporting that provides information that would not otherwise have been known had the article  
not revealed it. Accurate, original, in-depth, and investigative reporting requires a high level of skill/talent and  
effort. Very high quality news content will include a description of primary sources and other original reporting  
referenced during the content creation process. Very high quality news content must be accurate and should  
meet professional journalistic standards.  
● **For artistic content** (videos, images, photography, writing, etc.): Unique and original content created by highly  
skilled and talented artists or content creators. Such artistic content requires a high level of skill/talent and effort.  
If the artistic content is related to a YMYL topic (e.g., artistic content with the purpose of informing or swaying  
opinion about YMYL topics), YMYL standards should apply.  
● **For informational content:** Original, accurate, comprehensive, clearly communicated, and should reflect expert  
consensus as appropriate. Expectations for different types of information may vary. For example, scientific  
papers have a different set of expectations than a social media post sharing information about a hobby such as  
stamp collecting. However, all types of very high quality informational content share common characteristics of  
accuracy and clarity of communication, in addition to meeting standards appropriate to the topic or field.  
The **Highest** rating may be justified for pages with very satisfying MC created with a very high level of effort, originality,  
talent, or skill.

#### 8.2 Very Positive Reputation

Reputation research is important when giving **Highest** ratings. For YMYL topics, very positive reputation is often based  
on recommendations from known experts or professional societies appropriate to the topic of the page. Prestigious  
awards may be evidence as well, depending on the topic and type of content.  
For non-YMYL topics, reputation information may be less formal. Popularity, user engagement, and user reviews can be  
considered evidence of reputation for non-YMYL websites: websites and content creators can be considered to have a  
very positive reputation if they are seen as one of the best sources available online for a topic or type of content.  
**Remember:** Many smaller websites and ordinary people have little reputation information. A page can still receive a  
**Highest** rating without reputation information.

#### 8.3 Very High Level of E-E-A-T

Very high E-E-A-T is a distinguishing factor for **Highest** quality pages. A website or content creator who is the uniquely  
authoritative, go-to source for a topic has very high E-E-A-T. A content creator with a wealth of experience may be  
considered to have very high E-E-A-T for topics where experience is the primary factor in trust. A very high level of  
expertise can justify a very high E-E-A-T assessment. Very high E-E-A-T websites and content creators are the most  
trusted sources on the internet for a particular topic.  
Think about what E-E-A-T means for the topic of the page. How important is first-hand experience? Who are the  
experts? What makes a source highly authoritative for the topic? What makes a website or content creator trustworthy  
for the topic? Standards for very high E-E-A-T will differ depending on the topic of the page.

### 9.0 Page Quality Criteria for Specific Types of Pages

#### 9.1 Ratings for Encyclopedia Pages

There are many encyclopedia-type websites. Some are highly-respected publications that are standard references, while  
some are websites with content created and edited by anonymous users, with no editorial oversight or fact checking. We  
may not always know the author of the specific encyclopedia article, and therefore must rely on website reputation  
research to determine the E-E-A-T of the article. **High** and **Highest** quality ratings should only be used for encyclopedias  
with very good reputations for accuracy and expertise, where the article itself is well-researched with appropriate  
references cited.  
A note about Wikipedia: in general, the website has a good reputation and is a very popular resource that is generally  
valued for accuracy. However, there is no single author or organization that vouches for the accuracy of Wikipedia  
articles, and the quality of pages varies. You should check individual articles to evaluate the quality of the MC.  
A Wikipedia article on a non-YMYL topic ( example ) with a satisfying amount of accurate information and trustworthy  
external references can usually be rated in the **High** range. A PQ rating in the **Medium** range is often appropriate for  
pages with less extensive MC and external references. Naturally, Wikipedia articles with very little MC should get lower  
PQ ratings. Factual inaccuracy is a sufficient reason for a **Low** or **Lowest** rating.

#### 9.2 Ratings for Pages with Error Messages or No MC

In PQ rating tasks, you may encounter pages with error messages or other types of "broken" pages. Please think about  
whether the page offers help for users—did the website owner make an effort to ensure that users visiting the page have  
a good experience and get help finding what they are looking for?  
Pages with an explicit error (or custom 404\) message are often **Medium** quality, since they tend to clearly communicate  
that there's a problem and help users navigate to other/better pages on the website. A rating of **High** (or occasionally  
even **Highest** ) may be used for the rare error message page that involves a high level of effort and original content and  
provides a truly satisfying experience for users.  
Pages that are "broken" are often **Low** quality, because the broken aspect prevents them from achieving their purpose  
even if the problem is temporary and likely to be fixed later on by the website owner. However, sometimes "broken"  
pages should be rated **Lowest** if the problem is not temporary and instead is due to a systemic problem with the website.  
To differentiate between **Low** quality (temporarily broken) vs. **Lowest** quality (evidence of a systemic problem) pages,  
check other pages on the same website. If many other pages have the same problem, there is a systemic lack of effort  
on the part of the website owner that justifies the **Lowest** rating. Otherwise, use the **Low** rating to reflect the (hopefully  
temporary\!) issue with the MC on the page.  
Here are some examples:  
**Webpage/Type of Content Characteristics of the Page PQ Rating and Explanation**  
Lowest: Deliberately created with  
no MC (systemic problem)  
● No MC  
● Content created with little to no effort, little  
to no originality, and little to no added  
value for website visitors  
This is an example of a page with no MC. You  
might think that the MC is “missing” due to a  
problem with this particular page, but in fact,  
this website has hundreds of pages that look  
the same—no MC, just Ads. This website  
shows Ads with little or no attempt to help  
users, and should be rated **Lowest** quality.

**Webpage/Type of Content Characteristics of the Page PQ Rating and Explanation**  
Low: Page didn't fully load and  
has no MC (temporarily broken)  
● No MC (probably due to a temporary  
technical error)  
● Positive website reputation  
This page has no MC and no error message. It  
is an isolated example of a page with no MC or  
error message on a website for a reputable  
newspaper for a town in Michigan. All of the  
navigation links work, and the page was later  
fixed. This page can be viewed as lacking in  
effort (an error that was not caught before the  
page went live).  
Medium: Error page with custom  
404 message ●^ Nothing wrong, but nothing special^  
This is an example of a “custom 404” page,  
alerting users that the URL they are trying to  
visit no longer exists. Some websites do a nice  
job of alerting users about a problem and  
providing helpful tips.  
This page is on a well-known merchant website  
with a good reputation. However, this particular  
page displays the bare minimum of content  
needed to explain the problem to users, and  
the only helpful content is a link to the  
homepage.  
High: Error page with custom 404  
message  
● Satisfying MC: achieves the purpose of  
the page well  
● Positive website reputation  
This is an example of a “custom 404” page,  
alerting users that the URL they are trying to  
visit no longer exists. This website does a nice  
job of explaining the issue and providing helpful  
tips, including a search box.  
Highest: Error page with custom  
404 message  
● Very satisfying MC: achieves the purpose  
of the page very well  
● Very positive website reputation  
This is an example of a “custom 404” page.  
These pages are designed to alert users that  
the URL they are trying to visit no longer exists.  
The MC of this page is the cartoon, the caption,  
and the search functionality, which is specific to  
the content of the website. It is clear that effort  
and talent was involved in the creation of the  
MC.  
This publication has a very positive reputation  
and is specifically known for its cartoons, which  
allows us to go as high as High+ to Highest.  
This is among the most clever, original, and  
satisfying custom 404 messages that can be  
found online\!

#### 9.3 Ratings for Forums and Q\&A Pages

Ratings for forum and Q\&A pages can be challenging. Here is some guidance on how to approach these pages:  
**● The Main Content includes the question, the answers/responses, and the resulting discussions.**  
● **Rate from the point of view of a user who visits the page** , rather than a participant involved in the discussion.  
● **Users who post answers/responses or comments are often identified only by a username or alias.** A page  
can be **High** or **Highest** quality with just usernames or aliases depending on other criteria.  
● **The E-E-A-T of a discussion among users can often be judged by the posts or comments themselves.**  
○ For some topics, Experience is the most important dimension of Trust. For other topics, assessing  
Expertise through the posts may be important. In some cases, the posters themselves will highlight either  
their own Experience or Expertise, or other people will comment on it.  
○ Pages on YMYL topics require more attention to Trust and more care in the assessment of E-E-A-T.  
● **Highest quality forum/Q\&A pages** have extremely satisfying conversations, including participation from users  
who have put a great deal of effort into their posts and have a wealth of Experience and/or Expertise on the topic.  
Such conversations can be very satisfying because of the depth of discussion, the unique insights, or the sharing  
of experiences that many would not have access to in their real-world community.  
● **Low quality forum/Q\&A pages** often lack effort (few responses, surface-level rather than in-depth discussion),  
lack Experience or Expertise, contain mild inaccuracies, or show a significant lack of respect or decorum among  
the participants that might deter others from joining the discussion.  
● **Lowest quality forum/Q\&A pages** may contain information or advice that is harmfully misleading, contradicts  
well-established expert consensus, encourages harm towards self or other individuals/participants, etc.  
One challenge is rating pages with little to no participation, and/or no answer to an open question:  
● A *new* page or *recently started* discussion that consists only of a question or initial post by a person should  
generally be rated **Medium** unless there are other low quality attributes. These pages may need time to achieve  
their purpose.  
● Over time, no participation in a discussion (or only superficial discussion) and/or no meaningful answer to an open  
question may be a reason for a **Low** quality rating, especially in the presence of other low quality attributes.  
Another challenge occurs when the discussion on the page drifts, becomes combative, or becomes dominated by  
misleading or spammy content. When rating, value the insightful, meaningful discussion that exists. If the page is a mix  
of high and low quality characteristics but has insightful, meaningful discussion, the **Medium** rating may be most  
appropriate as long as the page is not potentially harmful.  
Here are some examples:

**Webpage/Type of Content Characteristics of the Page PQ Rating and Explanation**  
Lowest: Q\&A page about chest  
pains and smoking  
● **Harmfully Misleading Information:**  
Contains inaccurate and potentially  
dangerous medical advice about a YMYL  
topic  
Information about chest pain and smoking  
could significantly impact people’s decisions to  
seek medical treatment. This page is on a  
YMYL topic.  
This page must be evaluated from the point of  
view of a user visiting this page from a search  
engine, rather than a participant. The question  
is poorly worded and difficult to understand.  
There aren't many responses. One response  
correctly warns about the danger of smoking  
cigarettes but suggests smoking marijuana  
instead. Another response suggests that it's  
fine to keep smoking and that aspirin can be  
used to address pain. The last response lacks  
respect: it asks if the person who asked the  
original question is stupid.  
The answers have incorrect and potentially  
dangerous medical advice, making it lowest  
quality MC.  
Low: Q\&A page about a 2002  
Volvo part  
● Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the  
page: does not achieve the purpose well  
● Misleading page design  
Please read the MC (areas with red boxes  
around it), including the completely unhelpful  
"answer." This answer is so unhelpful, we can  
consider this question to be unanswered. This  
page has an unsatisfying amount of MC.  
In addition to a very unhelpful “answer,” the  
page design makes it difficult to distinguish the  
MC from Ads. For example, below the answer,  
we see a "sponsored answer," which has the  
same format as the real answer, but is actually  
an Ad and not an answer to the question—this  
is a misleading page design.  
Medium: Forum page with a new  
question, posted by a person  
**Nothing wrong, nothing special**  
● Real in-depth question, posted very  
recently  
● No one has responded (yet)  
Forums rely on user engagement to create  
satisfying MC. In this case, a real person has  
posted a question that can lead to good  
discussion. The question is only hours old (at  
the time this example was created).  
For new questions, discussions and threads, a  
Medium rating is appropriate if there are no low  
quality characteristics but also no opportunity  
for discussion yet.

**Webpage/Type of Content Characteristics of the Page PQ Rating and Explanation**  
Medium: Forum page on an  
online auction website  
**Mixed, but with some redeeming qualities:**  
● High E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page  
● Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the  
page: does not achieve the purpose well  
The relative lack of effort/participation in the  
discussion and depth of the MC is balanced by  
the high E-E-A-T of this forum. This forum is  
dedicated to this kind of question and therefore  
has a high level of expertise.  
Medium: Forum page on how to  
wash ballet shoes  
**Mixed, but with some redeeming qualities:**  
● Adequate MC: achieves the purpose of  
the page  
● Ads or SC significantly distract from or  
interrupt the use of MC  
● High E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page  
This forum is about dance topics, and many  
pages have expertise from a community of  
ballet dancers. On this particular page,  
participants have first-hand experience washing  
ballet shoes and make recommendations  
based on their own experiences.  
This page is “mixed” because there is some  
distracting content that makes it hard to read  
the MC. However, this is not a beauty contest\!  
Even though the page may be cluttered, there  
is some valuable E-E-A-T and helpful MC,  
making Medium a good rating for this page.  
High: Forum post on the magic  
loop technique in knitting  
● MC is satisfying for the purpose of the  
page: demonstrates effort, originality,  
talent, or skill  
● High E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page  
The person who posted the first message on  
this forum page provides a helpful resource on  
how to master the magic loop technique in  
knitting (effort, skill). She also shares pictures  
of her own version using an old pair of blue  
jeans (original content). With over 20 years of  
experience knitting socks, we would consider  
her to be an expert on the topic.  
High: Q\&A page about whether a  
Roomba will work  
● Satisfying MC: achieves the purpose of  
the page well  
● High E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page  
Many participants share their personal  
experiences with these products, giving details  
such as how well certain models work with pet  
hair (effort, first-hand experience, original  
content). There are many descriptions of  
participants’ own experiences with this product  
and how well it works for them, making the MC  
satisfying for the purpose of the page.

**Webpage/Type of Content Characteristics of the Page PQ Rating and Explanation**  
High: Forum page on  
authenticating a purse  
● Satisfying MC: achieves the purpose of  
the page well  
● Positive website reputation for the topic of  
the page  
● High E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page  
This forum is a go-to source for discussions on  
luxury designer purses (positive website  
reputation, experience, expertise, "go-to"  
authority). On this particular forum page,  
members are consulting forum experts who  
have expertise authenticating bags from this  
brand. These experts can tell if a particular bag  
is authentic or fake. The quality of the MC is  
high due to the level of effort, skill, and  
engagement among those who participate in  
the forum. While there is an ad at the top and a  
few ads within the forum message, it does not  
distract from the MC, which is easy to find.  
High: Forum page on landscaping  
an aquarium  
● Satisfying MC: achieves the purpose of  
the page well  
● High E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page  
This discussion focuses on the landscaping for  
a particular paludarium (an aquarium with  
terrestrial and aquatic elements). There is a  
lot of discussion and interaction between forum  
members about the types of materials and  
species used in the aquarium (effort, original or  
unique content). The posts show expertise in a  
niche topic aquarium landscaping (experience,  
expertise).  
Highest: Q\&A page about how  
long most cancer patients live  
● Very satisfying MC: achieves the purpose  
of the page very well  
● Positive website reputation for the topic of  
the page  
● Very high E-E-A-T for the purpose of the  
page  
How long a person may live with a disease  
could significantly impact life decisions. This is  
a YMYL topic.  
This is a Q\&A page on a medical question that  
is well-answered by non-experts with life  
experience. There are many responses  
describing how long a loved one lived after  
diagnosis. The focus of the page is  
experience, not medical advice. Many  
responses are based on personal experience  
and are helpful for this topic.  
Highest: Q\&A page on  
abbreviations  
● Satisfying MC: achieves the purpose of  
the page well  
● Very positive website reputation for the  
topic of the page  
● Very high E-E-A-T for the purpose of the

The purpose of the page is to answer questions  
about the usage of abbreviations, and it  
contains helpful information about common  
abbreviation issues. This website has a very  
good reputation as a reference for information  
on writing, publishing, etc. It is considered  
highly authoritative and trustworthy for the topic  
of the page.

### 10.0 Page Quality Rating Tasks

At first, PQ rating may seem difficult. There are several aspects of the page and the website to look at and think about.  
**Important** : Do not struggle with each PQ rating. Please give your best rating and move on. If you are having trouble  
deciding between two ratings, use the lower rating. If you are torn between three ratings, choose the one in the middle.  
Do not consider the country or location of the page or website for PQ rating. For example, English (US) raters should use  
the same PQ standards when rating pages from other English language websites (UK websites, Canadian websites, etc.)  
as they use when rating pages from U.S. websites. In other words, English (US) raters should not lower the PQ rating  
because the page location (UK, Canada) does not match the task location.  
These guidelines are specific to "regular" webpages. Occasionally, you may be asked to rate a landing page that is not a  
webpage. For example, you may be asked to rate a PDF file, a PNG or JPEG image file, etc. When the landing page of  
the URL is not a webpage, some of the criteria in these guidelines may not apply. In this case, please use your judgment.  
Finally, this Page Quality Rating Guideline does not completely cover every aspect of page quality. If you find pages that  
you truly believe to be **High** or **Low** quality, please rate them as such, even if the reason is based on something not  
covered in these guidelines. Please use the comment section to explain your reasoning. As always, use your judgment.

#### 10.1 Instructions for Rating Page Quality Tasks

**The Page Quality task page is broken up into several parts:**

1. Some initial questions about the task landing page.  
2. A “PQ grid” to record your observations about PQ characteristics of the landing page.  
3. The Overall PQ rating slider which records your Overall PQ rating.  
4. A comment box to explain your rating.  
   Some results to the initial questions will end the task early. If the page is Porn, Foreign Language, Did Not Load, or  
   consists of restricted or inaccessible MC (e.g., subscription is required to view MC), you will not fill in the PQ grid or assign  
   an overall rating.  
   ● **Foreign Language** should not be used when the language on the landing page is in the task language, a  
   language that is commonly used by a significant percentage of the population in the task location, or English.  
   ● **Did Not Load** should be used for pages where there is absolutely no content on the page created by the website.  
   There is no MC, SC, or Ads on the page. See this Wikipedia article for descriptions of different types of error  
   messages.  
   The PQ grid is designed to be your "note pad." It allows you to record your observations about the landing page and the  
   website it belongs to.

### 11.0 Page Quality Rating FAQs

Question Answer  
Why do we have to do all  
these steps? This takes a  
long time\!  
With practice, the amount of time needed for accurate PQ ratings will decrease. The  
steps are important and are designed to help you assess many different aspects of PQ.  
You may be surprised by what you find. Pages that initially look Low quality may turn  
out to be Medium or High quality with careful inspection. The reverse may happen as  
well. We want your most informed, thoughtful opinion.  
Are we just giving High  
quality ratings to pages that  
“look” good?  
No\! The goal is to do the exact opposite. These steps are designed to help you  
analyze the page without using a superficial “does it look good?” approach.  
Is sharing a personal  
experience or opinion a  
beneficial purpose? What if  
the personal opinion is  
upsetting or offensive?  
Sharing a personal experience or opinion can be a beneficial purpose as it allows  
people to appreciate different perspectives. Content on the Internet can help people  
understand why others think and feel the way they do.  
It can be valuable to see the opinions and perspectives of others, even when they are  
off-putting, distasteful, upsetting, or offensive to you personally. Apply the standards of  
these guidelines rather than your own personal opinions or views.  
However, sometimes opinions and perspectives can spread misleading information or  
otherwise have the potential to cause harm. Therefore, apply the standards in these  
guidelines to all types of pages and content.  
Remember : Your assessment of harm happens before and overrides other  
considerations such as the life experience or expertise of the content creator.  
Can life experience justify a  
Highest quality rating for a  
page on a YMYL topic?  
Factual information and advice on YMYL topics should come from experts. Sharing life  
experience on YMYL topics can be Highest quality, but it must be trustworthy, safe,  
consistent with well-established expert consensus, and speak to topics that life  
experience is valuable for.  
For example, information about when and where to vote is a YMYL topic. It's possible  
to have a Highest quality page that shares life experience about voting, such as an  
inspiring personal post about becoming a citizen and voting for the first time. However,  
if a page about someone's voting experience gives inaccurate information about when  
and where to vote either deliberately or through careless oversight, the page should be  
rated Lowest because it could cause others to miss the opportunity to vote.  
You talked about expertise  
when rating MC. Does  
expertise matter for all  
topics? Aren't there some  
topics for which there are  
no experts?  
Remember that we are not just talking about formal expertise. Informal expertise is  
equally important, and for some topics may be a more common type of E-E-A-T.  
For most page purposes and topics, you can find experts even when the field itself is  
niche or non-mainstream. For example, there are expert alternative medicine websites  
created by leading practitioners of acupuncture, herbal therapy, etc. There are also  
pages about alternative medicine written by people with no expertise or experience.  
E-E-A-T should differentiate between these two scenarios.  
Reminder : If the page is harmful to people or society, untrustworthy, or spammy as  
defined in these guidelines, expertise and experience doesn't matter. It should be rated  
Lowest.

**Question Answer**  
**When I think about E-E-A-T,**  
**it seems like expertise and**  
**experience overlap a lot.**  
**What's the difference?**  
Here's one way to think about it:  
● **Expertise** often involves objective, testable knowledge or skills, for example:  
can you calculate the load bearing weight of a bridge?  
● **Experience** can be more subjective and is often shared through personal  
narration, for example: how does it feel to experience love for another person?  
For PQ rating, it's not important to distinguish between expertise and experience.  
Instead, focus on what kind of content is trustworthy and satisfying for the purpose of  
the page. You may find that both expertise and experience can be trustworthy and  
satisfying for the same topic. For example, a medical website may be a trustworthy  
source for treatment options, and the experiences of other people who have gone  
through treatment may provide emotional support and prepare you for what to expect.  
**Aren't some types of pages**  
**always Low quality, such as**  
**celebrity gossip?**  
For almost any type of page or informational topic, there is a range of content quality.  
For example, there are both **High** and **Low** quality celebrity gossip pages. The purpose  
of these pages is to share interesting, accurate information about celebrities. There  
may be benefits in celebrity stories that inspire others or help people going through  
similar challenges. A celebrity gossip page is **High** quality if it has accurate and  
interesting information, has no characteristics of Low or Lowest quality, and comes from  
a reasonably reliable source.  
**I've never seen a High**  
**quality page of type X. If**  
**there are no high quality**  
**pages of this type, why are**  
**we giving existing pages a**  
**Low quality rating?**  
For some topics or types of pages, there may not be many (or any\!) High quality pages  
now, but there may be in the future. We need a uniform set of standards that apply to  
all pages, even for pages that have not yet been created.  
**Some of these criteria seem**  
**unfair. For example, some**  
**art pages do not have a**  
**purpose. Are these pages**  
**Low quality?**  
Art pages do have a purpose: artistic expression. Pages created for artistic expression  
do not deserve the **Low** quality rating simply because they have no other purpose.  
Artistic expression, humor, entertainment, sharing photos and videos, etc. are all valid  
and beneficial page purposes.  
**How should interstitials**  
**factor into my rating?**  
Sometimes clicking on the task URL will bring up an interstitial page. You can ignore  
this page in your rating criteria if you can easily get to the MC. However, if the  
interstitial makes it extremely hard (or impossible) to get to the MC and evaluate how  
well the page achieves its purpose, that should factor into your PQ rating.

## Part 2: Understanding Search User Needs

### 12.0 Understanding Search Users, Queries, and Results

Why do people search the Internet?  
People use Internet search engines to perform many different tasks in different environments using different types of  
devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, or computers. Keep in mind that searches can be simple or complex,  
and the underlying task that a person is trying to accomplish may take multiple steps to complete. For example, a simple  
task may be to find the director of a movie. A complex task may be to find a movie’s showtimes nearby, purchase tickets,  
and get directions to go to the theater. Overall, search engines should make it easy for people to complete tasks by  
surfacing helpful results right away.

#### 12.1 Important Rating Definitions and Ideas

**User:** A person who is searching. People search everywhere: people in all countries, speaking all languages; people of  
all ages, genders, races, religions, political affiliations, etc.  
**Query** : The text, image and/or other content that a user enters in a search engine search box or search app to do a  
search. In these guidelines, queries have square brackets around them to look like a search box. If a user says “coffee  
shops near me,” we display: \[coffee shops near me\]. If a user types “flights to New York” in the search box, we display:  
\[flights to New York\]. Queries may be spoken, typed, copied and pasted, come directly from a camera or other app,  
and/or be related searches that appear in search results.  
There are many different types of queries because people use search to do many things, from searching for specific  
websites to looking for answers to questions to browsing videos for inspiration to searching with an image to figure out  
where to buy a product.  
**Query interpretation** : The possible meaning(s) of the query or what the query may refer to. Many queries have more  
than one meaning. For example, the query \[apple\] might refer to the computer brand or the fruit or something else.  
**User Intent** : What the user is trying to accomplish when they search. For example, if a user searches for a movie, they  
may be interested in showtimes, reviews, cast, etc. For a specific query interpretation, there may be many possible user  
intents. A single user may have many different intents for a single query\!

**Locale** : All queries have a locale, which is the language and region for the task. Regions are represented by a two-letter  
country code, for example, "US" in the locale "English (US)". For a current list of country codes, click here. We  
sometimes refer to the locale as the task location.  
**User Location** : Sometimes more specific information about the location of the person searching is provided, usually a  
city or state. In rating tasks, this information may be shown on a map. User location is very important for understanding  
the query and what results are helpful for searches related to nearby places, such as \[coffee shops near me\]. For other  
searches such as \[how does gravity work\], user location is not important at all, as gravity works the same way  
everywhere.  
**Search Engine Results Page (SERP):** The page a search engine shows after a user enters a query in the search box.  
The SERP is made up of **result blocks**.  
**Result** : We will use the word **result** to refer to the result block *and* the landing page.  
● **Result Block:** This is an individual “block” that appears on the user’s device in response to the query. The result  
block may display information in the block itself or contain links, or may do both.  
● The **Landing Page** ( **LP** ) is the page you see after you click a link in the result block.

#### 12.2 Understanding the Query

Understanding the query is the first step in evaluating the task. Remember, a query is what a user types or speaks into  
their device.  
Some tasks include a query research link, which you should use if you don’t understand the query or user intent.  
Otherwise, please do web research using Google or an online dictionary or encyclopedia. If you still don’t understand the  
query or user intent, please release the task.  
**Important** : If you research the query on Google, please do not rely on the top results on the SERP. A query may have  
other meanings not represented on Google’s search results pages. Do not assign a high rating to a webpage just  
because it appears at the top of a list of search results on Google.  
Think about users in your locale typing or speaking the following queries into their phone.  
**Query User Intent**  
\[population of paris\], English (US) Find the current population of Paris, France.  
\[starbucks near me\], English (US) Find the nearest Starbucks location.  
\[weather\], English (US) Find weather information in the user location right now.

#### 12.3 Locale and User Location

All queries have a task language and task location (referred to in rating tasks as the "Locale"). The locale is important for  
understanding the query and user intent. Users in different locales may have different expectations for the same query.  
Some tasks show a user location in addition to a locale.  
However, for many or most queries in a given locale, the user location does not change our understanding of the query  
and user intent. Here are some examples: \[facebook.com\], \[pictures of kittens\], \[distance between the earth and the  
moon\].  
When is the locale or user location important in understanding query interpretation and user intent? Please use both web  
research and your personal judgment to answer this question. Ask yourself, “Would people in one city or country be  
looking for something different than people in another city or country?”

#### 12.4 Queries with an Explicit Location

Sometimes people tell search engines exactly what kinds of results they are looking for by adding the desired location in  
the query, regardless of their own location. We'll call this location inside the query the “explicit location.” The explicit  
location makes queries much easier to understand and interpret.  
 “My mom is coming  
to visit. I need to find a  
hotel for her nearby”  
Query: \[ Dallas hotels\]  
Locale: English (US)  
User Location: Dallas,TX  
Explicit Location: Dallas  
 “I need a hotel for my  
trip to New York”  
Query: \[ New York hotels\]  
Locale: English (US)  
User Location: Dallas,TX  
Explicit Location: New York  
Sometimes the explicit location matches the user location or locale, and sometimes it doesn't.  
When there is an explicit location in the query, pay attention to it\! People use explicit locations to indicate exactly what  
they are looking for.

#### 12.5 Queries with Multiple Meanings

Many queries have more than one meaning. For example, the query \[apple\] might refer to the computer brand or the fruit.  
We will call these possible meanings **query interpretations**.  
**Dominant Interpretation** : The *dominant interpretation* of a query is what most users mean when they type the query. Not  
all queries have a dominant interpretation. The dominant interpretation should be clear to you, especially after doing a  
little web research.  
**Common Interpretation** : A *common interpretation* of a query is what many or some users mean when they type a query.  
A query can have multiple common interpretations.  
**Minor Interpretation** : Sometimes you will find less common interpretations. These are interpretations that fewer users  
have in mind. We will call these *minor interpretations*.  
● **Reasonable minor interpretations** : Reasonable minor interpretations may help fewer users, but they still are  
helpful to have in a set of results because different users may want different things.  
● **Unlikely minor interpretations** : An unlikely minor interpretation is an interpretation that is in theory possible but  
is very unlikely \- very few users are likely to have this in mind.  
**No chance interpretation** : An interpretation so unlikely that almost no user would have this in mind. Results for no  
chance interpretations feel off-topic even if they match the query words. For example, almost no one wants a result about  
an overheated pet for the English US query \[hot dog\].

**Query: \[apple\]**  
**Locale: English (US)**  
Note: There are many interpretations for this query; only a few are shown for the purposes of this example.  
Computer company Fruit Person’s name City  
**Dominant Interpretation Common Interpretations Unlikely Minor Interpretation**  
**Query: \[mercury\]**  
**Locale: English (US)**  
Note: There are many interpretations for this query; only a few are shown for the purposes of this example.  
Planet Chemical  
Element  
Insurance  
company  
Boat engine  
company  
British aircraft  
designed during WWII  
**Common Interpretations**  
**Reasonable Minor**  
**Interpretations**  
**Unlikely Minor Interpretations**

Some queries have few possible interpretations or intents because the query specifically states what users are looking for.  
Here are some examples:  
**Query User Location**  
**Reasonable query**  
**Interpretation/User Intent**  
**Not a reasonable query**  
**interpretation or user intent**  
\[lewis county non  
emergency number\]  
Centralia, WA,  
USA  
Users are looking for a  
non-emergency number for help in  
Lewis County, WA.  
An emergency number for Lewis  
County is not a reasonable minor  
intent.  
Pay attention to important words in  
the user query, in this case, “non  
emergency”. Users can become  
frustrated when results ignore  
important words.  
\[is egg salad healthy\] NA  
Users are looking for health  
information about egg salad, such  
as calories, fat, and the  
healthfulness of eggs and other  
common egg salad ingredients, etc.  
Recipes for egg salad ( that do not  
include any nutritional information  
about egg salad) are not a  
reasonable minor intent for this  
health information search. People  
may be interested in recipes as a  
next step, but the user issuing the  
query is specifically looking for  
health information, not food  
preparation.  
Some recipes may mention the  
query topic (such as healthier egg  
salad alternatives), but not actually  
answer the user’s query.  
Pay attention to what users want  
and need for a search.  
\[can bears climb  
mountains\]

###### NA

Users are looking for the answer to  
a know-simple question about the  
climbing ability of bears.  
Learning about mountain climbing  
opportunities in Bears Ears national  
monument is not a reasonable minor  
intent.  
Just because a result matches  
several key words in the query does  
not mean it is relevant or helpful to  
the user.

#### 12.6 Query Meanings Can Change Over Time

Remember to think about the query and its current meaning as you are rating. We will assume users are looking for  
current information about a topic, the most recent product model, the most recent occurrence of a recurring event, etc.,  
unless otherwise specified by the query.  
**User in 1994 User in 2004**  
41 st^ US president  
  
Query: \[George  
Bush\]  
Locale: English (US)  
43 rd^ US president  
  
Query: \[George  
Bush\]  
Locale: English (US)  
**User in 2007 User in 2022**  
iphone 1  
  
Query: \[iphone\]  
Locale: English (US)  
iphone 13  
  
Query: \[iphone\]  
Locale: English (US)  
The interpretation of the query \[iphone\], English (US) has changed over time as new iPhone models are released. The  
first iPhone was introduced in 2007\. Users searching for \[iphone\], English (US) at that time were looking for the new (at  
the time) first iPhone model. Most users now are looking for the most recent or upcoming iPhone model. In the future,  
new models will come out and the dominant interpretation will change again.

#### 12.7 Understanding User Intent

It can be helpful to think of queries as having one or more of the following intents.  
● **Know** query, some of which are **Know Simple** queries  
● **Do** query, when the user is trying to accomplish a goal or engage in an activity  
● **Website** query, when the user is looking for a specific website or webpage  
● **Visit-in-person** query, some of which are looking for a specific business or organization, some of which are  
looking for a category of businesses

##### 12.7.1 Know and Know Simple Queries

The intent of a **Know** query is to find information or explore a topic. Users want to **Know** more about something.  
**Know Simple** queries are a special type of **Know** query. **Know Simple** queries seek a very specific answer, like a fact,  
diagram, etc. This answer has to be correct and complete, and can be displayed in a relatively small amount of space.  
As a general rule, if most people would agree on a correct answer, and it would fit in 1-2 sentences or a short list of items,  
the query can be called a **Know Simple** query.  
**Know Simple** queries may be questions such as \[how tall is barack obama\]. Frequently, **Know Simple** queries do not  
have question words. For example, \[barack obama height\] has the same user intent as \[how tall is barack obama\], but is  
not in a question format.  
Most queries are *not* **Know Simple** queries, such as:  
● Broad, complex, and/or in-depth informational queries that do not have a short answer  
● Ambiguous or unclear informational queries  
● Informational queries on controversial topics  
● Informational queries with no definitive “right answer”  
● Queries where different users may want different types of information, or different sources of information  
● Queries where users want to browse or explore a topic  
● Queries where users want to find inspiration or ideas related to a topic  
● Queries where users are seeking personal opinions and perspectives from real people  
Here are some examples where the **Know Simple** query asks for a simple fact, which can be answered correctly and  
completely in a small amount of space, and the **Know** query answer is more complex.  
**Know Simple Query Know Query Explanation**  
\[barack obama height\]  
\[how tall is obama\] \[barack obama\]^  
The **Know** query is a broad information query and different  
users may be looking for different things (e.g., biography,  
books, social media posts, etc.).  
\[new york city population 2013\] \[new york city\]  
The **Know** query is a broad information query and different  
users may be looking for different things (e.g., tourist and trip  
planning information, facts, photographs, history).  
\[who is graves disease named  
after\] \[graves disease\]^  
The **Know** query is a broad query for medical information  
and different users may have different needs. There is no  
single “answer” for this query.  
\[macy’s store hours\] \[macy’s gift wrap options\]  
The **Know** query is a broad query for a particular service  
offered by a department store, and does not have a short  
answer.  
\[what is the symbol for the  
element nickel\]  
\[what nickel is used for\] The^^ **Know**^^ query is a broad query and there is no short,^  
complete answer.  
\[who won the 2014 bcs national  
championship game\]  
\[who is going to win the bcs  
national championship game\]  
The **Know** query asks for an opinion and there is no  
definitive answer.  
\[what is starbucks stock price\] \[should i invest in starbucks stock\]  
Even though the **Know** query is theoretically a yes/no  
question, there is not a single answer that everyone would  
agree on.

Know Simple Query Know Query Explanation  
\[weather\]  
\[how do people predict the  
weather\]  
The query \[weather\] may seem like a broad information  
query, but most people likely have a fairly simple  
informational need: to find the current or upcoming  
temperature, and the chance of local weather events such as  
rain or snow. Therefore, consider queries like \[weather\],  
\[weather today\], \[weather tomorrow\], \[weather this week\] to  
be Know Simple queries.  
In contrast, the Know query is a broad information query and  
different users may be looking for different things.  
\[what is a bowl cut\] \[hair styles for men with round faces\]  
Users who issue the Know query are likely seeking  
inspiration for a new hair style. There is no definitive right  
answer for this query.  
\[what is the social security  
retirement age\] \[retirement planning\]^  
The Know query is about a complicated and situational topic.  
Many users would issue this query with the intent of broadly  
exploring the topic, and different users would be better  
served by different information.

##### 12.7.2 Do Queries

The intent of a **Do** query is to accomplish a goal or engage in an activity. The goal or activity may be to download, to buy,  
to obtain, to be entertained by, or to interact with a website or app. **Do** queries may have a specific need to be  
immediately accomplished or they may be more open ended and involve browsing and subsequent searches to ultimately  
accomplish the goal.  
Note that the line between Do and Know queries is sometimes blurry, with some queries fitting into both categories. Don't  
worry about strictly differentiating between these two categories. They're given to illustrate some big-picture patterns in  
user intents, and many queries do not fit neatly into one and only one of these categories.  
Here are some examples of Do Queries.  
**Query Likely User Intent**  
\[get my GED online\] Obtain U.S. high school equivalency diploma online.  
\[online personality test\] Take an online personality test.  
\[what is my bmi?\] Calculate BMI (body mass index).  
\[pay parking ticket\] Pay for a parking ticket.  
\[watch stranger things\] Watch the TV show “Stranger Things”.  
\[shape of you video\] Watch the music video for the song “Shape of You” by Ed Sheeran  
\[music videos\]  
The user did not ask for a specific music video, but this query still has a likely Do intent because  
the user most likely issued the query with the intent of watching at least one music video after  
browsing options in the search results.  
\[small bathroom organization  
ideas\]  
Browse the web for ideas on ways to organize a small bathroom  
Note: This is an open-ended Do query where different kinds of content could be helpful. Some  
users may want to browse images and video to find visual inspiration, some may want to read  
how-to guides, and others may be interested in both.

##### 12.7.3 Website Queries

The intent of a **Website** query is to locate a specific website or webpage that users have requested. This single webpage  
is called the **target** of the query.  
One type of **Website** query is a URL Query, which can be:  
● Exact, perfectly-formed, working URLs, such as \[http://www.ibm.com\] or \[www.ibm.com\] or \[ibm.com\].  
● Imperfect URL queries: Queries that look like URL queries, but are not “working URLs”. These URLs do not load  
if you type or paste them into your browser address bar. Even so, we believe users have a specific page in mind.  
Here are some examples.  
**Query Likely User Intent**  
\[reddit login\] View the login page for Reddit.  
\[tiktok\] View the TikTok website.  
\[yahoo mail\] View the Yahoo Mail website.  
\[walmart.com\] View the Walmart website.  
\[feathermobility.com feather 13.5 lbs. wheelchair\] View the Feather 13.5 lbs. wheelchair product page on the Feather Chair website.

##### 12.7.4 Visit-in-Person Queries and User Location

People use search engines to look for **Visit-in-Person** information, such as finding nearby coffee shops, gas stations,  
ATMs, restaurants, etc.  
Some queries clearly “ask” for nearby information or nearby results (e.g., businesses, organizations, other nearby places).  
Some queries are not asking for nearby information or nearby results. Here are some examples.  
**Queries with Visit-in-Person Intent Query with Non-Visit-in-Person Intent**  
 “I want to find a car repair  
shop.”  
Query: \[car repair shop\]  
Locale: English (US)  
 “How tall is Mount Everest?”  
Query: \[how tall is mt everest\]  
Locale: English (US)  
 “I need to find a gas  
station right away\!”  
Query: \[gas stations\]  
Locale: English (US)  
 “I would like to take an IQ  
test online.”  
Query: \[iq test\]  
Locale: English (US)  
**More examples** : \[pizza\], \[yoga class\], \[grocery stores\], \[movie  
showtimes\], \[car repair\], \[dentists\], \[bank of america atm  
locations\], \[library near me\]  
**More examples** : \[boston red sox\], \[scrabble cheat\], \[definition of  
sedentary\], \[aapl\], \[beyonce\], \[minecraft\], \[small dog breeds\],  
\[dance videos\], \[oscars\], \[silly jokes\], \[bank of america login\]

And some queries could go either way. Some users may want nearby results and others may not.  
 “I want to go to a  
Walmart near me.”  
Query: \[walmart\]  
Locale: English (US)  
 “I want to shop online  
on the Walmart website”  
Query: \[walmart\]  
Locale: English (US)  
Here are some examples of queries with both visit-in-person and non-visit-in-person intent:  
● \[hotels\]  
● \[post office\]  
● \[h\&m\]  
● \[library\]  
● \[bank of america\]  
● \[the gap\]  
Sometimes, the user location can change our understanding of the query. For users close to Austin, Texas, the query  
\[verbena\] could have two different interpretations: a popular restaurant named Verbena or the plant verbena.  
 “What is the address  
of Verbena?”  
Query: \[verbena\]  
Locale: English (US)  
User Location: Austin,TX  
 “I want to learn more  
about the plant verbena.”  
Query: \[verbena\]  
Locale: English (US)  
User Location: Austin, TX

In most other user locations, there is no restaurant (or anything else) named Verbena and there is just one interpretation  
of the query \[verbena\]: the plant. The Austin restaurant is not well-known outside of Austin, TX.  
 “I want to learn more about  
the plant verbena.”  
Query: \[verbena\]  
Locale: English (US)  
User Location: Flint, MI  
Use your common sense when thinking about queries and whether they have possible visit-in-person intent.

##### 12.7.5 Queries with Multiple User Intents

Many queries have more than one likely user intent. Please use your judgment when determining if a particular intent is  
reasonable for queries with multiple intents. Because so many people search for so many things, err on the side of  
considering interpretations and intents to be reasonable and doing query research as needed.  
**Query Examples of Reasonable User Intent Examples of Unlikely User Intent**  
\[harvard\]  
Depending on the user need and location, users may want  
to visit the official homepage ( **Website** ), get directions  
( **Visit-in-Person** ), or learn more information about the  
school such as the application process or history, see  
recent news, or updates on sporting events ( **Know** ).  
This query is very broad. Different people may be  
looking for different things. However, it's fairly unlikely  
that someone is looking for a one specific Harvard  
course such as "The Science and Psychology of Music"  
for the broad query \[harvard\].  
\[walmart\]  
Users may want to go to a nearby Walmart  
( **Visit-in-Person** ) or view the homepage to shop online  
( **Website** ). Some users may want to learn more  
information about the company or see recent news, social  
media posts, etc ( **Know** ).  
This query is very broad. Different people may be  
looking for different things. However, it's fairly unlikely  
that someone is looking for a news article on Walmart's  
charitable donations from 2001 for the query \[walmart\].

#### 12.8 Understanding Result Blocks

The following sections contain examples of different types of queries and results.

##### 12.8.1 Web Search Result Block Examples

Web Search Result Blocks typically have a title link, a URL and a “snippet” of text describing the page. For many queries,  
Web Search Result Blocks are the most helpful type of result.  
**Query and User Intent Web Search Result Block**  
**Query:** \[cuisinart food processor reviews\]  
**User Intent:** This is a **Know** query. The user  
wants to find recent reviews of Cuisinart food  
processors.  
**Result:** This is a Web Search Result Block  
that has a link to a landing page with Cuisinart  
reviews.  
**Query:** \[broadway tickets\]  
**User Intent:** This is a **Know** query or **Do**  
query. The user wants to search prices and/or  
purchase tickets to a Broadway show in New  
York City.

##### 12.8.2 Special Content Result Block Examples

Special Content Result Blocks (SCRBs) appear in the search results page, along with Web Search Result Blocks.  
Special Content Result Blocks are designed to show content directly to users on the search results page. From working  
calculators to playable videos to interactive weather information, these results help users immediately get information or  
content. Some SCRBs may also have links to landing pages.  
**Important** : Please assume that any interactive features work and function properly. Some notes:  
● All result blocks are “screenshots” or images of search results with prominent links enabled. Unfortunately, a  
screenshot or image of an interactive result block will not function as it would for a real user. **For the purpose of**  
**rating, please assume that interactive result blocks do function as intended**. Try to interact with the result  
block as some links, buttons, or other features may work.  
● There may be a delay between when the rating task is created and when you actually rate the block, causing  
some information in special content result blocks to be a few hours or even days out of date. Stock price or  
weather informational blocks are designed to give users extremely current and timely information. However, due  
to a delay in rating time, the information may no longer be accurate. Don’t penalize a special content result block  
for being out of date. **Assume that the blocks show current information for users, unless instructed**  
**otherwise.**  
**Query and User Intent Special Content Result Block**  
**Query:** \[weather\]  
**User Location:** Chicago, Illinois  
**User Intent:** This is a **Know Simple** query  
since users have a fairly simple informational  
need: find the current temperature and chance  
of rain or snow. The user wants to know the  
weather for the User Location.  
**Note:** Assume the block shows current  
information for users.

**Query and User Intent Special Content Result Block**  
**Query:** \[emma stone movies\]  
**User Intent:** This is a **Know** query. The user  
wants to get information on movies with Emma  
Stone.

## Part 3: Needs Met Rating Guideline

### 13.0 Rating Using the Needs Met Scale

There are many different kinds of queries and results, but the process of rating is the same: **Needs Met rating tasks ask**  
**you to focus on user needs and think about how helpful and satisfying the result is for the users**.  
This is what the Needs Met rating slider looks like:  
**Rating Description**  
**Fully Meets (FullyM)**  
A special rating category, which only applies to queries with clear intent to find one specific  
result and the corresponding specific result the user is looking for.  
**Highly Meets (HM)**  
A very helpful result for any dominant, common or reasonable minor query interpretation/user  
intent.  
**Moderately Meets (MM)**  
A helpful result for any dominant, common or reasonable minor query interpretation/user  
intent.  
**Slightly Meets (SM)**  
A less helpful result for a dominant, common or reasonable minor interpretation/user intent  
OR a helpful result for an unlikely minor query interpretation/user intent.  
**Fails to Meet (FailsM)**  
A result that completely fails to meet the needs of all or almost all users. For example, the  
result may be off-topic for the query or address a no chance interpretation of the query.

#### 13.1 Rating Result Blocks: Block Content and Landing Pages

For Needs Met rating, you will assign a rating to each result. Each result includes the content inside the result block and  
landing pages associated with the result.  
Which part of the result do you rate? If a rating task specifically asks you to rate the Landing Page Needs Met or the  
Block Content Needs Met of each result, then you should follow the guidance in Section 13.1.1. Unless these specific  
versions of Needs Met ratings are requested, you should follow the guidance below:  
**Type of Block What to Rate**  
**Special Content Result Block**  
**(SCRB)**  
Note: Assume that interactive  
result blocks function as intended.  
Try to interact with the result block  
as some links, buttons, or other  
features in your rating task may  
work.  
The content inside this type of block should always play a large role in your rating.  
Some Special Content Result Blocks may have links to landing pages. In these  
cases, think about whether a user would click on the link in order to satisfy their  
user need.  
● If most users would not click, rate the Special Content Result Block based  
on the block content alone.  
● If some or many users would click, you may consider the helpfulness of the  
landing page(s) in addition to the content in the block. In this case, *both*  
need to be helpful to justify a high rating.  
**Web Search Result Block** A click is required, and you should evaluate the landing page to assign a rating.

For example, think about the query \[what does love mean\].  
**Result Block Query: \[what does love mean\] Rating**  
**Special Content Result Block**  
Most users would probably not click on  
the Special Content Result Block,  
because the block contains a large  
amount of helpful content and has no  
obvious landing page link associated  
with it.  
Therefore, base your rating on the  
content inside the block itself.  
**Web Search Result Block**  
In this case, users would have to click on  
the web search result in order to get an  
answer to the question.  
Therefore, base your rating on the  
content of the landing page.

Here are some examples of Special Content Result Blocks where the block should be rated primarily on the content inside  
the block itself. As always, please use your judgment.  
**Query and Special Content Result Block**  
**Query** : \[utopia animal hospital\] **Query** : \[chicago weather\] **Query:** \[calories in a banana\]  
**Query** : \[how to find security code on  
visa\]  
**Query** : \[how did Lincoln die\] **Query** : \[movies san francisco\]  
Note: The guidance in this section specifically applies to Needs Met ratings. For Special Content Result Blocks that have  
landing pages, you may or may not also be asked to provide PQ ratings. In these cases, your PQ rating should always be  
based on the landing page. Please refer to Section 14.0 for more about the relationship between Needs Met and Page  
Quality ratings.

##### 13.1.1 Landing Page Needs Met Ratings and Block Content Needs Met Ratings

In most cases, you should follow the instructions above when assigning Needs Met ratings. In some cases, though, a  
rating task may include special instructions that ask you to assign **Landing Page Needs Met** or **Block Content Needs**  
**Met** ratings. In these cases, follow the instructions below:  
**Type of Needs Met Rating What to Rate**  
**Landing Page Needs Met**  
Landing Page Needs Met ratings should be based **exclusively** on the landing  
page(s) links in the result block. This applies to both SCRBs and Web Search  
Result Blocks. The content that appears inside the result block should **not** factor  
into Landing Page Needs Met ratings.  
**Block Content Needs Met**  
Block Content Needs Met ratings should be based **exclusively** on the content  
inside the result block. This applies to both SCRBs and Web Search Result Blocks.  
Do **not** click through to any landing pages when rating Block Content Needs Met;  
landing page content should **not** factor into Block Content Needs Met ratings.  
● For Web Search Result Blocks, only consider the extent to which the page  
title, snippet, and any visual content within the block would directly address  
user need.  
● For SCRBs, only consider the extent to which the content within the block  
would directly address user need.  
**Needs Met** Follow the instructions in Section 13.1 for standard Needs Met ratings.

#### 13.2 Fully Meets (FullyM)

**Fully Meets** is a special rating category which only applies when all of the following are true:  
● The query interpretation and user intent is specific, clear, and unambiguous.  
● There is a specific website, a specific webpage, a specific know-simple fact or other specific result that all or  
almost all users in the rating locale and user location are looking for.  
● All or almost all users in the rating locale and user location would be completely satisfied by the result.  
Most queries cannot have a Fully Meets result. Most queries do not specify a single website or webpage. Most queries  
are not specific enough to have a single, know-simple fact as a comprehensive answer. For most queries, different  
people may want different types of results. For many queries, a single user may need to see many different results.  
You will need to use your judgment to decide whether a result block can **Fully Meet** the user's needs. Here are some  
scenarios when the **Fully Meets** rating is appropriate:  
● The user is clearly looking for a specific webpage or website and the result block with the specific webpage or  
website **Fully Meets** the user’s need.  
● All or almost all users in the rating locale or user location who search for this query would be looking for the same,  
specific fact or piece of information. The result block provides the information thoroughly, accurately, and clearly,  
and is from a trustworthy source acceptable for all or almost all users. Before using the **Fully Meets** rating for  
queries seeking a very specific fact or piece of information, you must check for accuracy and confirm that the  
information is supported by expert consensus where such consensus exists.  
Be conservative when using the **Fully Meets** rating. Even queries that seem to have a single right "answer" may benefit  
from more perspectives to satisfy all or almost all users. When in doubt, use a lower rating.  
Note: If a result block is very close to being fully satisfying, but the block alone may not be sufficient in order to fully satisfy  
all or almost all users, a rating of **Highly Meets** or **Highly Meets+** may be appropriate.

satisfying. For a query this  
specific, the user location does  
not change the rating.

##### 13.2.2 Examples of Queries that Cannot Have Fully Meets Results

There are some queries that *cannot* have a **Fully Meets** result. Here are some examples.  
**Type of Query Example No Fully Meets Result: Explanation**  
Broad queries where no  
single result could fully  
satisfy all users  
\[knitting\]  
This is a broad informational query. Knitting  
is an activity anyone can do and that anyone  
can create a website for. Different users  
may want different types of content: videos,  
instructions, patterns, etc. There is no one  
official source for knitting information and no  
one result could satisfy most users.  
Therefore, no **Fully Meets** result is possible  
for this query.  
Famous names  
e.g., \[barack obama\]  
This is a broad informational query and it is  
impossible to know exactly what the user is  
looking for.  
Ambiguous queries  
without a clear user intent  
or dominant interpretation  
\[ada\]  
There is no dominant interpretation for this  
query. The following entities are all common  
interpretations: Americans with Disabilities  
Act, American Dental Association, and  
American Diabetes Association. While each  
interpretation has an official homepage,  
none is **Fully Meets** since there is no  
dominant interpretation.  
Non-famous people names  
e.g., \[sam wen\]  
Queries for people’s names can be tricky.  
Many or most people queries do not have a  
dominant interpretation. Even unusual  
sounding name queries may not have a  
dominant interpretation. For example, the  
queries \[sam wen\], \[tran nguyen\], and \[david  
mease\] can have no **Fully Meets** result  
because there are multiple people with each  
of these names, and it is not clear that most  
users are looking for any one particular  
individual.

#### 13.3 Highly Meets (HM)

A rating of **Highly Meets** is assigned to very helpful results for any dominant, common, or reasonable minor interpretation  
or user intent of the query.  
**Highly Meets** results are highly satisfying and a good “fit” for reasonable interpretations and intents. In addition, they  
often have some of the following characteristics (depending on the query):  
● Entertaining or enjoyable for queries with a reasonable entertainment intent  
● Representative of the opinions, perspectives and experience of real people for queries with no single right answer  
● For informational queries, very helpful results that, for example:  
○ Are easy to understand the content, e.g., helpful images or videos, an easy to understand summary  
○ Provide in-depth or insightful content, e.g., a deep dive explanation, an expert analysis  
● For queries that benefit from recently created content, fresh results that provide up-to-date content on “what  
everyone is talking about right now” e.g., breaking news on a topic or the latest viral video or a hot new fashion  
trend  
**Highly Meets** results may be any type of content: articles, short form or long form video, images, social media posts,  
forum discussions, etc. There is no length requirement for **Highly Meets** results. Sometimes what makes a result  
satisfying is that it is short and easy to understand. Other results may be very satisfying because of the depth and  
richness of content. For some queries, comprehensiveness may be critically important, such as queries about truly  
complex topics or YMYL queries for which a short answer could be misleading.  
Accuracy is required for **Highly Meets** informational results. **Highly Meets** information pages on YMYL topics must be  
accurate and trustworthy. **Highly Meets** medical and scientific information pages must represent well-established  
scientific/medical consensus unless the user is clearly seeking an alternative viewpoint.  
A query can have many **Highly Meets** results. Search engines should strive to provide a diverse set of **Highly Meets**  
results from a variety of websites in a variety of content types from a variety of people and perspectives. This is especially  
important for queries with no single, "right answer", subjective queries, queries with multiple intents and interpretations,  
queries seeking opinions and perspectives, and queries simply looking to browse or explore the web.  
For most queries, **Highly Meets** is the highest possible rating a result can receive. Results rated **Highly Meets** represent  
the most helpful content available for a given query interpretation and user intent. Some queries have several **Highly**  
**Meets** results because there is a variety of very helpful content available on the internet that addresses reasonable query  
interpretations and user intents. Other queries may have no **Highly Meets** results at all because very helpful content  
doesn't exist on the internet or search engines are unable to find it. The standard for **Highly Meets** is very high.

that these blocks are  
interactive—clicking on a coffee

Meets— even though this a very

shops near the user location.

etc.).  
Seeing images of trestle bridges  
is very helpful in understanding  
this type of bridge. In this case,  
“a picture is worth a thousand  
words”, meaning that a picture  
may be more helpful than a text  
description due to the unique  
design of the bridge.

Verbena or the plant verbena.  
Because the user is located in  
Austin, many users are probably  
looking for the restaurant.  
However, it is not completely  
clear because some users may  
want to find information about the  
plant. This result about the  
restaurant has satisfying  
information for users who want to  
visit it—the result **Highly Meets**  
the most likely user need.  
**Query:** \[kristen wiig\]  
**User Intent:** Find more  
information about the  
actress, comedian, writer,  
and producer.  
This is a fan site dedicated to  
Kristen Wiig. The website has  
comprehensive info including  
over 50,000 pictures and 300  
video clips, interviews, articles,  
and more. This is a very helpful  
result.  
**Query:** \[emily blunt\]  
**User Intent:** Find  
biographical information  
(e.g., filmography) or  
current news/celebrity  
gossip about Emily Blunt.  
This result shows popular movies  
starring the actress. This is a  
very helpful result for users  
looking for her filmography, a  
reasonable intent for the query.  
Highly Meets is an appropriate  
rating for this result.  
**Query:** \[1969 moon  
landing\]  
**User Intent:** Find accurate  
and authoritative  
information about this  
historical event.  
The LP for this web result  
contains information about the  
Apollo 11 moon landing on the  
official website of NASA, which  
was the organization that  
oversaw this mission in 1969\.  
The MC has a lot of helpful  
information and content,  
including a detailed summary,  
video footage, and images of the  
moon landing that users can  
view and explore. This is a very  
helpful result.

**Query and User Intent Result Rating Highly Meets Explanation**  
**Query:** \[jennifer aniston\]  
**User Intent:** Find images,  
recent news, information,  
etc. about Jennifer  
Aniston.  
This is a broad query for an  
actress. Different users may be  
looking for different things.  
This result shows recent news  
about Jennifer Aniston. The  
articles are timely (at the time  
this was written) and relatively  
interesting, and not just common  
everyday news about the  
actress. This is a very helpful  
result for a reasonable intent.  
**Query:** \[mentos and coke  
death\]  
**User Intent:** Find accurate  
information about a rumor  
that a mixture of Mentos  
and Coca-Cola can cause  
death, which was spread  
on the Internet in 2006\.  
This LP is on a well-known  
fact-checking and debunking  
website. The page calls this  
story "False", then provides a  
credible explanation of how the  
authors came to that conclusion,  
including history of similar urban  
legends. This is a very helpful  
result.  
**Query:** \[avatar the way of  
water movie review\]  
**User Intent:** Find reviews  
of the 2022 film *Avatar:*  
*The Way of Water*.  
This discussion post includes  
snippets of reviews for the  
queried film by various sources.  
Various participants have also  
added to the discussion by  
commenting on the post. This is  
a very helpful result.  
**Query:** \[seattle,  
washington\]  
**User Intent** : Find  
information, news, maps,  
etc. related to Seattle,  
Washington.  
The result shows a map of  
Seattle, Washington and clicking  
on the map brings up a more  
detailed map. This is a very  
helpful result for a reasonable  
user intent.

#### 13.4 Moderately Meets (MM)

A rating of **Moderately Meets** is assigned to helpful results for any reasonable interpretation or user intent of the query,  
including reasonable minor interpretations and intents.  
**Moderately Meets** results have fewer valuable attributes than **Highly Meets** results. **Moderately Meets** results should  
still “fit” the query, but they are less satisfying than Highly Meets results. For example:  
● Moderately Meets results may be less representative of the opinions, perspectives and experience of real people  
for queries with no single right answer  
● For informational queries, Moderately Meets results might have content that is slightly harder to understand than  
Highly Meets results  
● Moderately Meets results may be a slightly out of date for queries that benefit from recently created content  
A query can have many **Moderately Meets** results. Moderately Meets results exist in all formats (video, audio, text,  
image) and on many types of websites: professional websites, corporate websites, forums, social media, etc.  
**Moderately Meets** is an acceptable rating if you see aspects of the result that are **Highly Meets** but other aspects seem  
**Slightly Meets**.  
There is nothing "wrong" with **Moderately Meets** results. **Moderately Meets** results are not out-of-date or inaccurate.  
**Moderately Meets** results are generally average to good.

##### 13.4.1 Examples of Moderately Meets (MM) Result Blocks

Query and User Intent Result Rating  
Moderately Meets  
Explanation  
Query: \[emperor penguin\]  
User intent: Find  
information, photos, or  
videos about emperor  
penguins.  
This is a cute short (14 second)  
video of a baby emperor penguin  
walking to a fully-grown emperor  
penguin.  
This is a helpful result for the  
reasonable interpretation and  
intent to find cute photos or  
videos of emperor penguins.  
However, the result is not very  
satisfying or very helpful for this  
query. Moderately Meets is  
appropriate.  
Query: \[where is virginia  
in the us\]  
User Intent: Find where  
the state of Virginia is  
located in the U.S.  
This is a helpful result for the  
reasonable interpretation and  
intent to know what states border  
Virginia. However, the result is  
not very helpful as it lacks visual  
information (e.g., map).  
Moderately Meets is  
appropriate.

**Query and User Intent Result Rating**  
**Moderately Meets**  
**Explanation**  
**Query:** \[kristen wiig\]  
**User Intent:** Find more  
information about the  
actress, comedian, writer,  
and producer.  
This is a helpful result as it is  
Kristen Wiig’s official website.  
However, the result is not very  
helpful because there is little  
content and has not been  
updated in years. **Moderately**  
**Meets** is appropriate.  
**Query:** \[how much does a  
camel cost\]  
**User Location** : Las  
Vegas, Nevada  
**User Intent:** Find  
information about the  
typical cost of a camel,  
most likely closest to the  
user location.  
The user might be interested in  
many things, such as the initial  
purchase cost of a camel, around  
the world, or for their location, or  
the ongoing cost for caring for a  
camel.  
The information in the result is  
helpful as a starting point but the  
overview does not fully address  
what a user in Las Vegas might  
be interested in.

#### 13.5 Slightly Meets (SM)

A rating of **Slightly Meets** is assigned to results that are less helpful for a reasonable query interpretation or user intent.  
A rating of **Slightly Meets** is also assigned to a helpful result for an unlikely query interpretation or intent.  
**Slightly Meets** can also be an appropriate rating for a result which is related to the user’s information need without fully  
addressing it, as long as it provides some value to the user. However, if the user is looking for a specific piece of  
information, a result which does not provide that information, or a result which misses a key aspect of the query, cannot be  
rated **Slightly Meets** and should be rated **Fails to Meet**.  
Slightly Meets results may have some aspect that prevents a higher rating, for example they may have outdated  
information.  
A query can have many **Slightly Meets** results. **Slightly Meets** results exist in all formats (video, audio, text, image) and  
on many types of websites: professional websites, corporate websites, forums, social media, etc.  
Often there is nothing "wrong" with **Slightly Meets** results \- they may simply be a less helpful "fit" for the particular query  
in the rating task. A **Slightly Meets** result for one query may be a **Highly Meets** result for a different query.  
**Important:** Many users decide which result to click or tap on based on the content in the result block, such as the title of  
the web result on the search results page. (Note that these titles usually come from webpages.) A result with a very  
misleading or exaggerated title should be rated **Slightly Meets** or lower, due to the poor user experience that occurs  
when the landing page does not match the expectation of the user when clicking or tapping on the result.

##### 13.5.1 Examples of Slightly Meets (SM) Result Blocks

Query and User Intent Result Rating Slightly Meets Explanation  
Query: \[britney spears\]  
User Intent: Find  
information about Britney  
Spears (e.g., current  
news, pictures).  
The LP of this web result has a  
2006 article about Britney Spears  
filing for divorce. This is very old,  
stale news, making this result  
less helpful for users.  
Query: \[honda odyssey\]  
User Intent: We will  
assume that users are  
interested in the current  
Honda Odyssey model,  
unless specified otherwise.  
Although the LP has  
comprehensive information from  
a reputable source, the  
information is about the 2010  
Honda Odyssey. This  
information would be considered  
stale for the query today, making  
this result less helpful for users.  
Query: \[hot dog\]  
User Intent: Find  
information about hot  
dogs, such as recipes or  
nutrition information.  
The LP of this web result is about  
the movie “Hot Dog,” an obscure  
film which came out in 1984\.  
Even though the landing page  
has good content, this is an  
unlikely minor interpretation of  
this query.  
Query: \[what type of  
sharks live in rivers\]  
User Intent: Find  
information about what  
types of sharks live in  
rivers.  
This result block does not  
contain enough information to be  
fully satisfying and mentions only  
one type of shark. This is not a  
very helpful result.

**Query and User Intent Result Rating Slightly Meets Explanation**  
**Query:** \[ibm\]  
**User Intent:** Go to the  
IBM website or find  
information about the  
company.  
This block contains images of the  
logo for IBM. These images are  
not a very helpful result for an  
unlikely minor intent of the query.  
**Query:** \[chase\]  
**User Intent:** Most users  
are looking for the official  
Chase bank website or a  
nearby branch. Some  
users may be interested in  
information about the  
bank.  
**User Location** : Kansas  
City, MO  
Most users in this locale are  
looking for the official Chase  
bank website. Very few people  
are looking for a definition of this  
common word. This is not a  
helpful result for most people.  
**Query:** \[bears swimming\]  
**User intent:** Find images,  
videos or information  
about bears swimming.  
Most users are looking for  
information about real bears, or  
images/videos of real bears  
swimming. This page sells a  
novelty t-shirt with an image of a  
bear swimming in a human  
athletic competition, which not  
many users would be looking for.  
**Query** : \[allergy symptoms\]  
**User intent** : Find  
information about allergy  
symptoms.  
This news article (current as of  
fall 2024\) discusses falling  
leaves as an allergy trigger. The  
article does list some common  
seasonal allergy symptoms.  
However, this is not a medical  
resource, and it does not cover  
allergy symptoms for common  
issues such as food allergies,  
etc. Given that this may be a  
YMYL topic, a medical resource  
would be more helpful.  
There are many different types of  
allergies and many different  
allergy symptoms. This is a very  
specific article about falling  
leaves and has some allergy  
symptom information, but likely  
few people would find it very  
helpful.

**Query and User Intent Result Rating Slightly Meets Explanation**  
**Query:** \[djokovic fastest  
serve speed\]  
**User Intent:** Find  
information about Novak  
Djokovic's fastest recorded  
tennis serve speed.  
The user is interested in an  
objective, single, specific fact  
and the result doesn't directly  
provide this. It includes some  
related information, including an  
approximate partial response  
(‘over 200 km/h’).  
**Query:** \[monmouth il  
which county\]  
**User Intent:** Find out the  
county for Monmouth,  
Illinois.  
This Landing Page provides a  
trustworthy, accurate answer, but  
it is presented incidentally and  
indirectly, requiring the reader to  
infer the fact:  
“Monmouth College was opened,  
which to some is considered  
“Warren County’s greatest  
asset”,  
“Monmouth truly is a great asset  
to Warren County and the United  
States. “

#### 13.6 Fails to Meet (FailsM)

A rating of **Fails to Meet** should be assigned to results that fails to meet the needs of all or almost all users. **Fails to Meet**  
results have some aspect that causes them to be unhelpful for the query, such as a lack of attention to an aspect of the  
query (or user location) that is critical for satisfying the user intent. **Fails to Meet** may also be used for results that have  
incorrect or very outdated information. **Fails to Meet** results may be helpful for a no chance interpretation. **Fails to Meet**  
results may be off-topic for any query interpretation.  
Search results should never surprise people with unpleasant, upsetting, offensive, or disturbing content. For this reason,  
all of the following types of content should be rated **Fails to Meet** if it is clear that the user is not looking for such content:  
● Harmful to Self or Other Individuals ( Section 4.2 )  
● Harmful to Specified Groups ( Section 4.3 )  
● Harmfully Misleading Information ( Section 4.4 )  
● Untrustworthy ( Section 4.5 )  
● Spammy ( Section 4.6 )  
● Porn ( Section 15.1 )

##### 13.6.1 Examples of Fails to Meet (FailsM) Result Blocks

Query and User Intent Result Rating Fails to Meet Explanation  
Query: \[can penguins  
climb\]  
User Intent : Find  
information about whether  
Penguins are able to climb  
or not.  
The result is about climbing a  
rock formation called The  
Penguins in the Arches National  
Park. This result is off-topic and  
does not answer the likely user  
intent of whether penguins can  
climb or not.  
Query: \[mike\]  
User Location: Eustis,  
Florida  
User Intent: Find  
information about  
something related to Mike.  
Note: For this query, it is  
unlikely users want to go  
anywhere in person.  
This is a broad query and it is  
unclear exactly what the user is  
looking for.  
This result block shows  
visit-in-person information for two  
businesses that contain the  
name Mike. However, the query  
is very broad and it is very  
unlikely these businesses are  
what users seek given the query.  
Query: \[united 656\]  
User Intent: Find  
information about flight  
656 operated by United  
Airlines (e.g., whether the  
flight is on time, what gate  
it is departing from).  
This result shows information for  
a church, an event venue, and  
the closest airport. However,  
users clearly want to know  
details about a specific flight, and  
there is absolutely no information  
in the block about the flight. This  
result Fails to Meet the needs of  
the user.

**Query and User Intent Result Rating Fails to Meet Explanation**  
**Query:** \[german cars\]  
**User Intent:** Find  
information about German  
cars or go to the official  
homepage of a German  
automaker.  
This LP is the homepage of  
Subaru, a Japanese car  
company, not a German car  
company.  
This result completely **Fails to**  
**Meet** the needs of the user.  
**Query:** \[company to get  
rid of the possum in my  
attic\]  
**User Location:**  
Naperville, Illinois  
**User Intent:** Find a  
company to trap and  
remove a possum from the  
attic.  
This LP is the homepage of a  
pest control company in  
Australia. U.S. users would need  
a U.S. company to take care of  
this problem. There is a  
mismatch between the page and  
the locale that makes this result  
helpful for no users—it  
completely **Fails to Meet** the  
needs of the user.  
**Query:** \[starting jets  
quarterback 2001\]  
**User Intent:** Find the  
name of the starting  
quarterback for the New  
York Jets football team in

2001. 

Although this is a trustworthy  
website for information about  
NFL football, this LP does not  
contain the information  
requested by the user. This  
result **Fails to Meet** the needs of  
the user.  
**Query:** \[doctor salary\]  
**User Location** : San  
Francisco, California  
**User Intent:** Find  
information about doctor  
salaries.  
The answer in this block is about  
the cost of education, not salary,  
which is misleading and doesn’t  
answer the user’s query.  
**Query:** \[who invented  
stairs\]  
**User Intent:** Find out  
about the origin of stairs.  
The answer provided in this  
result block is factually  
inaccurate. Stairs have been a  
common architectural feature of  
buildings, pathways, outdoor  
structures, etc. since long before  
1948, and they were not invented  
by a person named Werner  
Bösendörfer.

**Query and User Intent Result Rating Fails to Meet Explanation**  
**Query:** \[batman\]  
**User Location:** Anaheim,  
California  
**User Intent:** Find  
information about the  
fictional superhero that  
appears in American  
comic books, movies, and  
television shows.  
It is extremely unlikely  
(potentially a no chance  
interpretation) that this query is  
looking for information on a city  
in Turkey called Batman, given  
that the user is located in the  
United States. This result **Fails**  
**to Meet** the needs of the user.  
**Query:** \[non-dairy options  
at Marianne's Ice Cream  
vs The Penny Ice  
Creamery\]  
**User Location:** Santa  
Cruz, California  
**User Intent:** Compare the  
non-dairy options between  
two different ice cream  
shops.  
The user wants to know about  
the non-dairy options at both of  
the named ice cream stores,  
most likely to compare which  
store has more appealing  
options. This response only  
mentions a single non-dairy  
option (vegan dark-chocolate  
sorbet) at one of the stores,  
which does not satisfy the user  
intent to compare the specific  
options available at each of the  
stores.  
**Query:** \[how long is  
oppenheimer movie\]  
**User Intent:** Find  
information about the  
runtime of the 2023 film  
*Oppenheimer*.  
While the Landing Page  
technically contains an answer,  
the context around the answer  
does not give the user  
confidence that the answer is  
correct. The answer is  
presented in a quote by an actor  
in the film who is expressing  
some uncertainty around the  
length of the film ("I think it's  
almost three hours.”).

**Query and User Intent Result Rating Fails to Meet Explanation**  
**Query:** \[weather paris,  
texas\]  
**User Location:** Paris,  
Texas  
**User Intent:** Find current  
weather information for  
Paris, Texas.  
This result completely fails to  
satisfy the user intent, which is to  
find weather information for  
Paris, Texas, and *not* Paris,  
France.  
**Query:** \[go kart for sale\]  
**User Location:**  
Warrington, Pennsylvania  
**User Intent:** Find go karts  
for sale in the Warrington,  
Pennsylvania area.  
This result block shows a go kart  
arcade in Warrington,  
Pennsylvania, and two other go  
kart arcades in the surrounding  
area. These arcades are places  
to go ride go karts, not purchase  
them, so the result completely  
**Fails to Meet** the user intent.  
**Query:** \[ralphs\]  
**User Location:** San  
Clemente, California  
**User Intent:** There are  
two possible user intents:  
most users probably want  
to visit a nearby Ralphs  
location or go to the  
website.  
Ralphs is a nationwide  
supermarket chain. These  
locations are all in San Diego,  
California, which is a major city  
south of the user location (about  
60 miles away). These results  
are too far to be helpful.

**Query and User Intent Result Rating Fails to Meet Explanation**  
**Query:** \[amazon\]  
**User Location:** Austin,  
Texas  
**User Intent:** Go to the  
Amazon website.  
Users issuing this query want to  
go to the Amazon website.  
Showing information about how  
to visit or call the corporate office  
for an online company would not  
be helpful. At the time this  
example was written, the  
Amazon corporate office was not  
open to the public; very, very few  
people ever go to an Amazon  
corporate office. If someone  
needed to go to the office for an  
interview or business visit, they  
would need to get that  
information from someone at the  
company or would use a more  
specific query.  
**Query:** \[what is the closest  
large city\]  
**User Location:** Myrtle  
Beach, South Carolina  
**User Intent:** Find the  
closest large city to Myrtle  
Beach, South Carolina.  
A news result is completely  
unhelpful for this query. This  
result **Fails to Meet** the needs of  
the user.  
**Query:** \[australian open  
mens singles result 2008\]  
**User Intent:** Find a page  
that displays the 2008  
men’s singles result for  
this tennis tournament.  
This LP is about the 2004  
Australian Open, not the 2008  
Australian Open. It does not pay  
attention to an aspect of the  
query that is important for  
satisfying user intent (i.e., 2008).  
The result **Fails to Meet** the user  
intent.  
**Query:** \[tooth loss five  
years old\]  
**User Intent:** Find  
information about tooth  
loss in a five-year-old  
child.  
This LP has information about  
tooth loss in pike fish and has the  
words “five years old” on the  
page. This result **Fails to Meet**  
the user intent because it has  
keyword matches only and is  
unhelpful for the query.  
**Query:** \[what is wedding in  
spanish\]  
**User Intent:** Find how to  
say the word “wedding” in  
Spanish.  
The translation in the result block  
is completely wrong and  
inaccurate.  
Mañana means “tomorrow,” not  
“wedding.”

**Query and User Intent Result Rating Fails to Meet Explanation**  
**Query:** \[american express\]  
**User Intent:** Go to the  
American Express card  
website or get information  
about the company and its  
products and services.  
The LP is a humorous blog post  
about a wife helping her husband  
to buy a suit. The page mentions  
“American Express,” but is  
insufficiently related to the query  
to be helpful for users, so it **Fails**  
**to Meet** the user intent.  
Note: Even if this blog post were  
more recent, it would still fail to  
meet the user intent.  
**Query:** \[how to quit  
smoking\]  
**User Intent:** Find  
information on ways to quit  
smoking.  
This LP has gibberish text. Read  
this sentence: “How do you make  
a cigarette symbol on the  
keyboard? In.” This result is  
unhelpful for the query.  
**Query:** \[air canada phone  
number\]  
**User Intent:** Find the  
customer service phone  
number for the airline Air  
Canada.  
Remember that you should  
check for the factual accuracy of  
answers. For this result, go to  
the company’s page at  
[http://www.aircanada.com/en/customer](http://www.aircanada.com/en/customer)  
care/int/ and select USA to check  
the number shown here.  
According to the airline’s website,  
the correct phone number is  
1-888-247-2262. Because this  
answer is incorrect, it should be  
rated **Fails to Meet**.  
**Query:** \[miley cyrus\]  
**User Intent:** Find  
information about the  
American singer/actress  
Miley Cyrus, such as  
biographical info,  
discography/filmography,  
current news, etc.  
Miley Cyrus was alive at the time  
this example was written. This  
LP is an article written by an  
unknown author that was  
designed to look like a news  
story and falsely states that she  
died. The article has not been  
updated, clarified, or removed  
even days after having been  
proven false. This result is  
useless so it should be rated  
**Fails to Meet**.  
Remember: Just because a  
website has the look and feel of  
a traditional news site does NOT  
mean that you should consider  
the reporting to be factually  
accurate without further  
research. Watch out for sites  
that present themselves as  
news, but were actually created  
with the intent to mislead or  
misinform users.

**Query and User Intent Result Rating Fails to Meet Explanation**  
**Query:** \[who is hitler's  
daughter\]  
**User Intent:** Find the  
name of or information  
about Adolf Hitler's  
daughter, if Hitler in fact  
had a daughter.  
This LP is a blog post presenting  
a factually unsupported  
conspiracy theory that Angela  
Merkel is the daughter of Adolph  
Hitler. Because the MC is  
inaccurate and misleading, it  
completely **Fails to Meet** the  
user intent, even though the topic  
of the page matches the query.  
Note: A more helpful result for  
this query might confirm that  
Adolf Hitler had no children, or  
provide information on the novel  
*Hitler's Daughter* by Jackie  
French.

### 14.0 The Relationship between Page Quality and Needs Met

The Needs Met rating is based on *both* the query and the result. You must carefully think about the query and user intent  
when assigning a Needs Met rating.  
The Page Quality rating slider does *not* depend on the query. Do not think about the query when assigning a Page  
Quality rating to the LP.  
Some results don’t have a Page Quality slider. If a result block has no Page Quality rating slider, you do not have to give  
a Page Quality rating. If there is a Page Quality slider, please assign a Page Quality rating based on the landing page.  
Here is some guidance about assigning Needs Met and Page Quality ratings:  
● Useless results should always be rated **FailsM** , even if the landing page has a high Page Quality rating. Useless  
is useless.  
● The **HM** rating is not appropriate if a page is untrustworthy or has any other undesirable characteristics, such as  
outdated or inaccurate information. There are very high standards for the **HM** rating.  
● A page can have such low Page Quality that it is unhelpful or even harmful, such as gibberish pages or scams.  
These types of extremely low quality pages should be rated **FailsM** because the Page Quality issues interfere  
with helpfulness. (An exception is queries with clear website intent, where the target website should be rated  
**FullyM**. People are allowed to search for any website and search engines should honor that intent when it is  
clear.)

**Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating Explanation**  
**Query:** \[symptoms of  
dehydration\]  
**User Intent:** Find  
information about the  
symptoms of  
dehydration.  
**Needs Met** : Even though the  
article is topical, the information is  
not trustworthy and is potentially  
misleading or harmful. This result  
is unhelpful for the query.  
**Page Quality** : This is a YMYL  
topic. This page has no evidence  
of medical expertise/authority and  
is not trustworthy.  
**Needs Met** : This is a very helpful  
result for the query.  
**Page Quality** : This is a YMYL  
topic. This page is on a highly  
authoritative medical website and  
has a lot of reliable and accurate  
MC. This page is very  
trustworthy.  
**Query:** \[how many  
octaves on a guitar\]  
**User Intent:** Find out the  
number of octaves on a  
guitar.  
**Needs Met** : This block shows the  
number of octaves on a piano, not  
a guitar. Even though this block  
has a link to a high quality landing  
page about pianos, the  
information shown in the block is  
inaccurate with respect to the  
query. This result **Fails to Meet**  
the user need.  
**Page Quality** : There is a lot of  
helpful MC on the landing page.  
The page has medium to high  
E-E-A-T. **Medium+** to **High** is an  
appropriate rating.

### 15.0 Rating Porn, Foreign Language, and Did Not Load Results

You will be asked to assign **Porn** , **Foreign Language** , and **Did Not Load** flags to result blocks when appropriate. Some  
rating tasks may also ask you to identify **Upsetting-Offensive** and/or **Not-for-Everyone** results.  
All flags should be assigned based on the result alone and do not depend on the query. Here is a screenshot of the flags:  
Click on the flag name to select it. The flag will turn red and change the “No” to “Yes.” For example, here is a result block  
that shows when the **Foreign Language** flag should be used.  
**Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Flag Explanation**  
**Query:** \[baidu.com\]  
**Locale:** English (US)  
**User Intent:** Go to the  
Baidu website.  
This LP is the homepage  
of the Baidu website.  
The result is the target  
page of the query, but is  
in a foreign language  
(Chinese).  
This result merits a  
**FullyM** rating and the  
**Foreign Language** flag.

#### 15.1 Porn Flag

Please assign the **Porn** flag to all porn pages, whether the query is porn-seeking or not. The **Porn** flag does not depend  
on the query or user intent.  
This flag should be used if the content inside the result block, or the content on the LP, is pornographic, including porn  
images, links, text, pop-ups, and/or prominent porn ads. An image may be considered porn in one culture or country, but  
not another. Please use your judgment and knowledge of your locale.  
**Remember** : The **Porn** flag is used to indicate that the result is porn. It doesn’t matter whether the query “asks for porn”.

#### 15.2 Needs Met Rating for Porn Results

##### 15.2.1 Needs Met Rating for Clear Non-Porn Intent Queries

If the user intent is clearly **not** porn-seeking, a landing page that has porn for its MC should be rated **Fails to Meet**.  
● When the user intent is clearly not porn, a porn result should be considered unhelpful or useless.  
● Uninvited porn is a very bad experience for many users.  
The following queries should be considered non-porn intent queries: \[girls\], \[wives\], \[mature women\], \[gay people\], \[people  
kissing\], \[boy speedos\], \[moms and sons\], \[pictures of girls\], \[pictures of women\], \[mothers and daughters\], \[cheerleaders\],  
etc.

Remember to assign the **Porn** flag for all porn pages. Use your judgment and represent users in your locale**.**  
**Query User Intent Landing Page Rating Porn Flag?**  
\[toys\], English (US) Find toys to buy.  
Example  
Warning – this page is porn.^ **FailsM**^^ Yes^  
\[how tall is a camel\], English (US) Find the answer to this question about camels.^ Example Warning – this page is porn.^ **FailsM** Yes  
\[car pictures\], English (US) Find pictures of cars. Example Warning – this page is porn.^ **FailsM** Yes

##### 15.2.2 Needs Met Rating for Possible Porn Intent Queries

Some queries have both non-porn and porn interpretations. For example, the following English (US) queries have both a  
non-porn and an erotic or porn interpretation: \[breast\], \[sex\]. We will call these queries “possible porn intent” queries.  
For "possible porn intent" queries, please rate as if the non-porn interpretation were dominant, even though some or many  
users may be looking for porn. For example, please rate the English (US) query \[breast\] assuming a dominant health or  
anatomy information intent.  
**Query User Intent Landing Page Rating Porn flag?**  
\[breasts\], English (US) Find anatomy or health information about breasts.^ Example **HM** No  
\[breasts\], English (US) Find anatomy or health information about breasts.^ Example Warning – this page is porn.^ **FailsM** Yes

##### 15.2.3 Needs Met Rating for Clear Porn Intent Queries

For very clear porn intent queries, assign a rating to the porn landing page based on how helpful it is for the user. Even  
though there is porn intent, the page should still be assigned a **Porn** flag.  
Do not simply rate all porn pages for porn queries as **MM** or **HM**. Even though the query is porn and the result is porn, the  
page must fit the query and be helpful to get a high Needs Met rating.  
Pages that provide a poor user experience, such as pages that try to download malicious software, should also receive  
low ratings, even if they have some images appropriate for the query.  
**Query User Intent Landing Page Rating Porn Flag?**  
\[freeones\], English (US)  
Navigate to the Freeones  
homepage.  
Example:  
[http://www.freeones.com](http://www.freeones.com/)  
Warning – this page is porn.  
**FullyM** Yes  
\[freeones\], English (US) Navigate to the Freeones^  
homepage.  
Example:  
[http://www.baberoad.com](http://www.baberoad.com/)  
Warning – this page is porn.  
**FailsM** Yes  
\[anime sex pictures\], English (US) Find anime sex pictures. Example Warning – this page is porn.^ **MM** to **HM** Yes  
\[cheerleader porn\], English (US) Find porn pictures of cheerleaders. Example Warning – this page is porn.^ **MM** to **HM** Yes

#### 15.3 Reporting Illegal Images

**Child Pornography**  
**Note:** When working on rating projects in any task location or locale, you must follow United States federal law, which  
considers child pornography to be illegal.  
**Definition of Child Pornography**  
An image is child pornography if it is a visual depiction of someone who appears to be a minor (i.e., under 18 years old)  
engaged in sexually explicit conduct (e.g., vaginal or anal intercourse, oral sex, bestiality or masturbation as well as  
lascivious depictions of the genitals), or sadistic or masochistic abuse. The image of sexually explicit conduct can involve  
a real child; a computer-generated, morphed, composite or otherwise altered image that appears to be a child (think of  
images that have been altered using “Photoshop”); or an adult who appears to be a child; and the image can be  
non-photographic (e.g., drawings, cartoons, anime, paintings, or sculptures) so long as the subject is engaging in sexually  
explicit conduct that is obscene. If it is indistinguishable from child pornography, it is child pornography.  
Even if the pornographic image depicts children in a literary (think of the famous book "Lolita"), political (think of political  
cartoons), artistic, or scientific context, please send the link to your employer/company as instructed below.  
Depiction of the genitals does not require the genitals to be uncovered. Thus, for example, a video of underage teenage  
girls dancing erotically, with multiple close-up shots of their covered genitals, or images of children with opaque underwear  
that focus on the genitalia could be considered child pornography.  
An image of a naked child (e.g., in the bathtub or at a nudist colony) is not considered child pornography as long as the  
child is not engaging in sexually explicit conduct, or the focus is not on the child’s genitalia. Visual depictions of adults who  
look like children (e.g., a 35-year-old man play-acting in diapers, or an obvious woman dressed as a school girl) are not  
child pornography. If you don't think it's a minor, it probably isn’t child pornography. However, if you cannot tell that the  
person in the image is over 18 (e.g., an under-developed 18-year-old whose body hair has been waxed), that is child  
pornography.  
**Reporting Instructions**  
Please report images containing child pornography (URLs only) as instructed by your employer/company.

#### 15.4 Foreign Language Flag

##### 15.4.1 Using the Foreign Language Flag

Please do not assign the **Foreign Language** flag when the language on the landing page is one of the following:  
● The task language  
● A language that is commonly used by a significant percentage of the population in the task location  
● English  
For example, most Catalan-speaking users in Spain also speak Spanish. Therefore, for rating tasks in Catalan (ES), the  
Foreign Language flag should NOT be assigned to landing pages in Catalan, Spanish, or English.

Here is a screenshot of a result block that shows when the **Foreign Language** flag would be used.  
**Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Flag Explanation**  
**Query:** \[baidu\]  
**Locale:** English (US)  
**User Intent:** Go to the  
Baidu website.  
This LP is the homepage  
of the Baidu website.  
The result is the target  
page of the query, but is  
in a foreign language  
(Chinese).  
This result merits a  
**FullyM** rating and the  
**Foreign Language** flag.  
**Important** :  
● Please assign the **Foreign Language** flag even if you personally understand the language, but most users in  
your locale do not.  
● Please assign the **Foreign Language** flag based on the language of the landing page, not the appearance of the  
result block.  
● Please remember to flag all foreign pages with the **Foreign Language** flag, even if most users in your locale  
would expect or want a foreign language page for the query.  
● Sometimes it is difficult to determine what language the landing page is in. The LP may have multiple languages  
or no words at all. In these cases, try to represent users in your locale. Does it feel like a foreign language page?  
When in doubt, don’t use the **Foreign Language** flag.

##### 15.4.2 Needs Met Rating for Foreign Language Results

You must assign a Needs Met rating for all result blocks in your task, even if the result blocks have a foreign language  
landing page.  
In most cases, pages you flag as **Foreign Language** should be rated **FailsM** , because they cannot be understood by  
most users in your locale and are therefore useless. Remember that if users in your locale can read the language, then  
you shouldn’t be using the **Foreign Language** flag. Occasionally, you will encounter helpful **Foreign Language** pages.  
If the query clearly indicates that most users would expect or want a foreign language result, then the Needs Met rating of  
the foreign language page should *not* be **FailsM**. For example, please assign the **FullyM** rating and **Foreign Language**  
flag for baidu.com if the query is \[baidu.com\], English (US).  
Videos are often an example where foreign language pages are helpful and desired. Think about user intent and what  
pages are good for users. If the query “asks” for a foreign language song, band, film, sporting event, etc., then a video of  
the song, band, film, sporting event, etc. is helpful since it can probably be understood or enjoyed even though it is in a  
foreign language. For these types of queries, foreign language results are often expected.  
If the video is someone talking about the song, band, film, or event, the result probably cannot be understood or enjoyed  
and should be assigned a **FailsM** rating and the **Foreign Language** flag.  
Note: If you are unable to evaluate the Page Quality rating of a **Foreign Language** result, you do not need to assign a  
Page Quality rating and can leave the slider at **N/A**.

**Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation**  
**Query:** \[video of celine dion  
singing s’il suffisait d’aimer\]  
**Locale:** English (US)  
**User Intent:** Watch a video of  
Celine Dion singing this song.  
This video is just what English (US) users are  
looking for, even though the video is not in  
English. The language of the LP is mostly  
English (even though the video is in French), so  
the **Foreign Language** flag is not needed.  
**Query:** \[kasal, kasali, kasalo\]  
**Locale:** English (US)  
**User Intent:** Watch a trailer of  
this Filipino film or find information  
about it.  
The query is for “Kasal, Kasali, Kasalo,” a  
Filipino film. The LP is a clip from the movie in  
Filipino (Tagalog), the language spoken in the  
Philippines. It would be helpful for many  
English (US) users who type the query, even  
though it is not in English. Use your judgment  
when deciding whether to assign the **Foreign**  
**Language** flag.

#### 15.5 Did Not Load Flag

##### 15.5.1 Using the Did Not Load Flag

**Did Not Load** is used to indicate technical problems with the webpage that prevent users from viewing any LP content.  
Use the **Did Not Load** flag when:  
● The MC of the landing page is a web server or web application error message and there is no other content on  
the page: no navigation links, no home link, no SC, and no Ads. See here for a Wikipedia page on different types  
of error messages.  
● The landing page is completely blank: no MC, no SC, and no Ads.  
Assign the **Did Not Load** flag based on the landing page, not the result block.  
Here is an example of a **Did Not Load** landing page. You cannot tell that the landing page doesn’t load by looking at the  
result block.  
**Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Flag Explanation**  
**Query:** \[douglas instruments\]  
**User Intent:** Navigate to the  
homepage of this website.  
This page displays a generic 404  
message. There is no MC, SC, or  
Ads on the page.  
This result merits a **FailsM** rating  
and the **Did Not Load** flag.  
Here are screenshots of other types of landing pages that should be assigned the **Did Not Load** flag: DNL1 , DNL2.  
You should **not** use the **Did Not Load** flag for:  
● Malware warnings, such as “Warning – visiting this site may harm your computer\!” ( example ).  
● Pages that have removed or expired MC (e.g., expired classified listing, removed social media post, products or  
services unavailable).  
● Pages that are inaccessible because you need a subscription to view the MC.

##### 15.5.2 Needs Met Rating and the Did Not Load Flag

All result blocks must be given a Needs Met rating. If the landing page truly doesn’t load, assign the **Did Not Load** flag  
and rate the page **FailsM**. True **Did Not Load** pages are useless.  
Sometimes the page partially loads or has an error message. Give Needs Met ratings based on how helpful the result is  
for the query. Error messages can be customized by the website owner and are part of a well-functioning website.  
Sometimes these pages are helpful for the query.  
Note: If you are unable to evaluate the Page Quality rating of a **Did Not Load** result, you do not need to assign a Page  
Quality rating and can leave the slider at **N/A**.

**Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality**^  
**Rating, Flags**  
**Explanation**  
**Query:** \[boys pink snow  
shoes\]  
**User Intent:** Find  
information about or  
purchase boys’ snow  
shoes.  
**Needs Met** : The MC has an error  
message, but the LP has a lot of SC.  
However, the page has no information  
about boys pink snow shoes and is  
unhelpful for the query.  
**Page Quality** : This LP is on a well-known,  
reputable merchant website. Despite the  
error message, this page does a nice job  
of explaining the issue and providing a  
search box, including helpful search tips  
and customer service information.  
Do not assign the **Did Not Load** flag.  
**Query:** \[bible passages\]  
**User Intent:** Find  
specific passages in the  
Bible.  
**Needs Met** : In spite of the customized “No  
results found” message on the LP, it has  
links to all passages in the Bible, organized  
by book. This is a very helpful result.  
**Page Quality** : This page is a well-known,  
reputable reference website. In addition to  
links to all passages in the Bible, this error  
page provides a search box as well as a  
suggestion explaining how to refine  
searches.  
Do not assign the **Did Not Load** flag.  
**Query:** \[broadway  
tickets\]  
**User Intent:** This is a  
**Know** query or **Do**  
query. The user wants  
to search prices and/or  
purchase tickets to a  
Broadway show in New  
York City.  
Clicking on this result block leads to a  
malware warning. You can assume that  
the page is malicious without continuing to  
the page. As discussed in Sections 4.5.5  
and 13.6, you should assign a **FailsM**  
Needs Met rating and **Lowest** Page  
Quality rating.  
Do not assign the **Did Not Load** flag.  
**Query:** \[paranormal  
activity\]  
**User Intent:** Learn more  
about the 2007 film  
*Paranormal Activity* or  
the associated film  
series.  
This page cannot be reached because the  
site's server IP address was not found.  
There is no MC, SC, or Ads on the page.  
This result merits a **FailsM** Needs Met  
rating, and no Page Quality rating is  
required.  
Assign the **Did Not Load** flag.

#### 15.6 Additional Flags in Some Rating Tasks

Some rating tasks may ask you to identify **Upsetting-Offensive** and/or **Not-for-Everyone** results.  
Mark content that may be upsetting or offensive from the perspective of a typical user in your locale as  
**Upsetting-Offensive** , keeping in mind that people of all ages, genders, races, religions, and political affiliations use the  
Internet to understand the world and other points of views.  
Mark content that may be unpleasant or uncomfortable for some people in your locale (e.g., content that may not be  
appropriate in a public space, professional environment, or school) as **Not-for-Everyone**.

### 16.0 Many Types of Helpful Results

Some queries may have many different possible meanings, or people may be looking for different things. Make sure to  
give Highly Meets ratings to very helpful results for all reasonable interpretations and intents, including reasonable minor  
interpretations.  
● Many queries have different possible meanings or interpretations. Don't assume – do query research\! Results for  
a diverse set of reasonable interpretations may be very helpful.  
● For any given query interpretation, different users may have different intents. For example, different people who  
search for \[avatar\] with the movie in mind could be seeking different kinds of information about the movie. Some  
may be seeking reviews, others could want to see what people are saying on social media, while others still could  
be interested in the cast or ways to watch the movie, etc. Results that satisfy different reasonable intents may be  
very helpful to different users.  
● It’s also possible for a single user to have many different intents for any given query interpretation. That is, one  
person searching \[avatar\] could be broadly interested in the movie, and that person might want to browse reviews  
and social media posts, see the cast, and find out how to watch the movie. A diverse set of results that satisfy  
different reasonable intents may be very helpful to individual users, too\!  
Results of different types may be helpful for many kinds of queries, including queries with a single, clear interpretation or  
intent. Consider what kinds of results are helpful for all queries you rate, including:  
● Different formats (e.g., text, video, image, audio)  
● Different experiences, perspectives and opinions (e.g., a personal blog or a social media post)  
● Different content depths (e.g., the 10 second summary video and the 1 hour deep dive documentary)  
● Different types of sites: corporate, not for profit, government, social media, forums, personal blogs, etc.  
● ... and many more\!  
Make sure all types of very helpful results get a Highly Meets rating. Some queries may benefit from a wide variety of  
helpful results:  
● Queries that seek experiences, opinions and perspectives, such as \[should i get a dog\], \[what does love feel like\]  
● Queries that are subjective, such as \[best music to run to\]  
● Exploration and browsing queries – users may need to see many different options, such as \[ideas for bathroom  
remodel\], \[black suit\], \[inexpensive engagement rings\]  
● Queries with no single, right answer, such as \[how to ask your boss for a raise\]

#### 16.1 Rating Queries with Both Website and Visit-in-Person Intent

Some queries have two possible strong intents:

1. **Go to the website** intent: in order to, for example, find out information, buy something online, make a reservation,  
   schedule an appointment, interact with customer support, or fulfill some other need that can be satisfied online  
2. **Visit-in-person** intent: user wants to visit the store, business, etc. in person  
   For these queries, result blocks that only satisfy one intent should NOT get a **Fully Meets** rating.

**Query and User Intent Result Block and LP Needs Met Rating and Explanation**  
**Query:** \[target\]  
**User Location:**  
Jacksonville, Florida  
**User Intent:** There are  
two possible strong user  
intents: most users  
probably want to visit a  
nearby Target location or  
go to the website to shop  
online, research  
products, find prices, etc.  
The result block shows three popular  
Target locations in Jacksonville, with  
information that is especially helpful  
for users who want to visit the store.  
This fulfills the user intent to find a  
nearby Target location.  
The result is very satisfying and fulfills  
the user intent to shop online or  
otherwise use the website.  
**Query:** \[dmv\]  
**User Location:**  
Belmont, California  
**User Intent:** There are  
two possible strong user  
intents: most users  
probably want to visit a  
nearby DMV location or  
go to the DMV website  
to renew a license, pay a  
fee, find some  
information, etc.  
The result block shows two nearby  
DMV locations, with information that is  
especially helpful for users who want  
to visit the locations. This fulfills the  
user intent to find a nearby DMV  
location.  
The result is very satisfying and fulfills  
the user intent to find information or  
otherwise use the website (e.g., to  
review a license, pay a fee).

Query and User Intent Result Block and LP Needs Met Rating and Explanation  
Query: \[citibank\]  
User Location: Palo  
Alto, California  
User Intent: There are  
two possible strong user  
intents: most users  
probably want to visit a  
nearby Citibank location  
or go to the website to  
bank online.  
The result block shows three nearby  
Citibank locations in the user location  
of Palo Alto. The information is  
especially helpful for users who want  
to visit the bank. This fulfills the user  
intent to find a nearby Citibank  
location.  
The result is very satisfying and fulfills  
the user intent to do online banking or  
otherwise use the website.

### 17.0 Specificity of Queries and Landing Pages

Some queries are very general and some queries are specific. Here are some examples that compare levels of specificity  
of English (US) queries:  
**Query More Specific Query Even More Specific Query**  
\[chair\] \[dining room chair\] \[ikea “henriksdal” highback upholstered chair\]  
\[library\] \[harvard library\] \[harvard anthropology library\]  
\[interview questions\] \[interview questions for teachers\] \[practice interview questions used for teach for america\]  
\[restaurants\] \[chinese restaurants\] \[takeout chinese restaurants in downtown Austin\]  
\[coffee shops\] \[starbucks\] \[red rock coffee mountain view\]  
Results for specific queries are easier to rate on the Needs Met scale because we know more about what the user is  
looking for. Giving a Needs Met rating for results for general queries can be difficult. As always, your rating is based on  
how helpful the result is for the query, not the specificity fit.  
When the query is a broad category, such as \[cafes\] \[restaurants\] \[hotels\] \[books\] \[tourist attractions in paris\] etc., popular  
and prominent examples may be considered very helpful. Please do web research to help you understand what is  
popular and prominent in different locations.

**Query and User Intent Result Block & LP, Needs Met & Page Quality Ratings Explanation**  
**Query:** \[credit cards\]  
**User Intent:** Users are  
probably looking to sign  
up for a credit card  
online, or want to  
research credit cards  
before signing up.  
Even though there are many options, a  
page for an individual company that offers  
different cards could be very helpful.  
**Needs Met** : This LP is more specific than  
the query, but could still be a very helpful  
result because Visa is a popular credit card  
company.  
**Page Quality** : Visa is a credit card  
company with high E-E-A-T that offers  
services for credit cards, banking, etc. and  
has a good reputation. **High+** to **Highest**  
is an appropriate rating.  
Even though there are many options, a  
page for an individual company that offers  
different cards could be very helpful.  
**Needs Met** : This LP is more specific than  
the query, but could still be a very helpful  
result because Discover is a popular credit  
card company.  
**Page Quality** : Discover is a company with  
high E-E-A-T that offers services for credit  
cards, banking, etc. with a good reputation.  
**High+** to **Highest** is an appropriate rating.  
This page offers a list of top credit cards in  
a variety of categories.  
**Needs Met** : This LP fits the query. It would  
be helpful for most users.  
**Page Quality** : This website helps  
consumers make money decisions. It has  
a good reputation, high E-E-A-T, and has  
been recommended by several major  
newspapers. **High** is an appropriate  
rating.  
This page describes a credit card that  
requires union membership.  
**Needs Met** : Since the credit card requires  
union membership, this result is an unlikely  
minor interpretation for the broad query  
about credit cards.  
**Page Quality** : This company is an expert  
on its own credit card, which is issued by  
HSBC Bank, a financial services  
organization with a good reputation and  
high E-E-A-T. **High** is an appropriate  
rating.

**Query and User Intent Result Block & LP, Needs Met & Page Quality Ratings Explanation**  
**Query:** \[hotels\]  
**User Intent:** Users are  
probably planning a trip,  
but this query is very  
general and vague.  
This is a popular travel aggregator website,  
and the hotel page on the site can help  
users find hotels in the U.S. Users can  
read reviews, compare hotels, or make a  
reservation.  
**Needs Met** : This LP fits the query. This is  
a very helpful result.  
**Page Quality** : Orbitz is a popular website  
with high E-E-A-T and a good reputation.  
**High** is an appropriate rating.  
This is a very popular hotel chain with  
hotels available in the majority of the U.S.  
at many different price points.  
Even though the list of possible hotel  
chains is long, the homepage of an  
individual chain that offers different prices,  
features, and location options could be  
very helpful.  
**Needs Met** : This LP is more specific than  
the query, but could still be a very helpful  
result because the Marriott is a popular  
chain of hotels.  
**Page Quality** : The Marriott website gives  
information on Marriott hotels, a popular  
chain of hotels. Marriott has a good  
reputation and is an expert on Marriott  
hotels, making the information on this page  
highly authoritative. **High+** to **Highest** is  
an appropriate rating.  
This is the webpage of the Marriott  
Courtyard hotel in Emeryville, California.  
**Needs Met** : The LP is too specific for the  
query, but this is a well-known brand and  
users can navigate to other Marriott hotels  
from this page. This is a less helpful  
result.  
**Page Quality** : The Marriott website gives  
information on Marriott hotels, a popular  
chain of hotels. Marriott has a good  
reputation and is an expert on Marriott  
hotels, making the information on this page

an appropriate rating.

### 18.0 Needs Met Rating and Freshness

Some queries demand very recent or “fresh” information. Users may be looking for “breaking news,” such as an important  
event or natural disaster happening right now. Here are different types of queries demanding current/recent results.  
**Type of Query Example Queries Explanation**  
“Breaking news” queries \[tornado\], \[tsunami\]  
Assume users need the information right away.  
Imagine someone who needs immediate weather information because  
a big storm is coming. Information about last year's weather would  
not be helpful.  
Recurring event queries,  
such as elections, sports  
events, TV shows,  
conferences, etc.  
\[olympics\], \[american idol\],  
\[redsox schedule\], \[tax forms\],  
\[elections\]  
Assume users are looking for the most recent or current information  
about the event.  
For example, if the Olympics are happening right now, users  
searching \[olympics\] want information about the current Olympics, not  
results from years ago. If the next Olympics are a few months away,  
users are probably interested in the  
upcoming Olympics.  
Current information  
queries  
\[population of paris\], \[amount of  
u.s. debt\], \[airfare from ny to sfo\],  
\[next federal holiday\]  
Assume users are looking for the most current information, such as  
prices or airfare.  
Product queries \[iphone\], \[toyota camry\], \[windows^  
operating system\]  
Assume users are looking for information about the most recent  
model/version for these product queries.  
When a query demands recent content, only pages with current, recent, or updated content should get high Needs Met  
ratings. For these queries, pages about past events, old product models and prices, outdated information, etc. are not  
helpful. They should be considered “stale” and given low Needs Met ratings. In some cases, stale results are useless  
and should be rated **FailsM**.  
For some queries, there may be “newsy” or recent information user intent, as well as more “timeless” information user  
intent. Users issuing queries for celebrities or politicians may be interested in biographical information, or users may be  
looking for the latest news or gossip.  
Freshness is generally less of a concern for Page Quality rating. “Stale” pages can have high Page Quality ratings. For  
example, some highly reputable news websites maintain “archival” content. However, unmaintained/abandoned “old”  
websites or unmaintained and inaccurate/misleading content is a reason for a low Page Quality rating.  
**Note** : The date the page was created may be different from when the content was last updated or modified. When  
content is updated, the page will sometimes show the date of the update, not the date the page was created. Some  
websites always show the current date, regardless of when the content was last updated. If you are curious about the  
content of a page, see here to try the “Wayback Machine” on the Internet Archive. Not all pages are available, but this  
tool may help you understand how some pages were created and how their content has changed over time.

**Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating Explanation**  
**Query:** \[los angeles  
traffic\]  
**User Location:** Los  
Angeles, California  
**User Intent:** Users are  
looking for **current**  
information about traffic  
conditions in Los  
Angeles. Even pages  
about traffic conditions  
the day before would be  
considered stale for the  
query.  
This LP shows traffic conditions in  
Los Angeles on August 7, 2012,  
which is the day this example was  
written.  
This LP shows traffic conditions in  
Los Angeles on August 6, 2012\.  
It is stale and useless for the  
query even though it is only one  
day old.  
**Query:** \[nobel peace  
prize winner\]  
**User Intent:** Find the  
name of the most recent  
winner of this prize. This  
is a **Know Simple** query.  
At the time this example  
was originally written,  
2011 was the most  
recent year that the  
Nobel Peace Prize was  
awarded.  
This LP on the New York Times  
website has information about the  
most recent winner of this prize,  
based on the date when this  
example was written.  
This LP on the BBC website has  
information about the 2006 winner  
of this prize. The 2006 winners of  
the prize may is an extremely  
minor interpretation of the query,  
so this page is stale for the query.

Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating Explanation  
Query: \[arthritis\]  
User Intent : Users are  
looking for information  
about this disease.  
Because there is  
ongoing research done  
on treatments and cures  
for most diseases, users  
are probably looking for  
authoritative, up-to-date  
information on arthritis.  
Medline Plus is an authoritative  
website that regularly updates its  
content.  
This 2006 article is extremely  
stale for this medical query. For  
this type of query, old medical  
news is generally unhelpful and  
potentially dangerous.  
Query: \[when was  
franklin d roosevelt born\]  
User Intent: Users want  
to find this well  
understood fact.  
This LP has the information users  
are looking for. This query does  
not require fresh results.  
We couldn’t find a stale page for this query. N/A

### 19.0 Misspelled and Mistyped Queries and Results

#### 19.1 Misspelled and Mistyped Queries

You will notice that some queries are misspelled or mistyped. Here are some examples of queries that are obviously  
misspelled:  
**Misspelled Query Query Interpretation**  
\[federal expres\], English (US) The only reasonable query interpretation is the company named Federal Express.  
\[new england patroits\], English US) The only reasonable interpretation is the NFL football team.  
\[byonce knowles\], English (US) The only reasonable interpretation is the famous singer/actress, Beyonce Knowles.  
Some misspelled or mistyped queries are more difficult to interpret. Use your judgment and do query research.  
For **obviously** misspelled or mistyped queries, you should base your rating on user intent, not necessarily on exactly how  
the query has been spelled or typed by the user.  
For queries that are **not** obviously misspelled or mistyped, you should **respect the query as written,** and assume users  
are looking for results for the query as it is spelled.

#### 19.2 Name Queries

Consider the query \[john stuart\], English (US). There is a very famous Jon Stewart, the comedian and former host of a  
popular U.S. television show. However, we should not assume that the query \[john stuart\] has been misspelled. There  
are many people named John Stuart. We will respect the query as written and assume the user is looking for someone  
named “John Stuart.”  
**Query and Possible**  
**User Intents Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating**^ **Explanation**^  
**Query:** \[mich ea l jordan\],  
English (US)  
**User Intent:** There are  
many people named  
“Micheal Jordan.”  
Helpful results for more  
prominent people named  
Micheal Jordan should  
receive higher ratings  
than helpful results for  
less prominent people  
named Micheal Jordan.  
Because Michael Jordan  
is such a famous  
athlete/celebrity, we will  
consider Michael Jordan  
to be an unlikely minor  
interpretation.  
The page lists all  
members of the LinkedIn  
site named “Micheal  
Jordan.” LinkedIn is a  
very popular social  
networking website for  
professionals in the U.S.  
This result would be very  
helpful for users trying to  
find information about  
someone named  
“Micheal Jordan.”  
This is a somewhat  
helpful result for an  
unlikely minor  
interpretation of the  
query.

### 20.0 Non-Fully Meets Results for URL Queries

Raters sometimes ask the question, “For a well-formed working URL query, are the only acceptable Needs Met ratings for  
a result either **Fully Meets** or **Fails to Meet** ?” The answer is no. There can be other helpful results for URL queries.  
Finding information about a website is a reasonable interpretation and intent for URL queries, as some users issue URL  
queries to find information about a website, such as reviews or recent news. We recommended this to you as one method  
of reputation research in the PQ guidelines. Real users do this too. Results that give reviews and reputation information  
can be very helpful for a URL query.  
However, websites that offer usage statistics about a website are not usually helpful results for URL queries. Most users  
aren’t interested in this kind of information.

**Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating Explanation**  
**Query:**  
\[potterybarn.com\]  
**User Intent:** Pottery  
Barn is a home  
furnishing store. Users  
may want to go to the  
website, do research, or  
find more information on  
the company.  
This LP is the target of the query.  
Online coupon codes are very  
popular in the U.S. and this LP  
(from a well-known coupon site)  
displays codes for online  
purchases on the Pottery Barn  
website. Users may be interested  
in coupon codes and this would  
be very helpful for those shopping  
online at potterybarn.com,  
especially frequent shoppers.  
This LP (from a well-known  
review site) has reviews of the  
potterybarn.com website. Users  
may be interested in reading  
reviews when considering  
whether to make purchases at  
potterybarn.com, especially new  
shoppers.  
**Query:**  
\[ratemyprofessors.com\]  
**User Intent:** Go to  
[http://www.ratemyprofessors.c](http://www.ratemyprofessors.c/)  
om , a website where  
students can rate their  
college professors.  
This LP is the target of the query.  
This LP is an extensive  
encyclopedia article for the  
queried URL. It contains many  
helpful sections, including  
information detailing the rating  
process, comparison with in-class  
evaluations, criticism, etc. This is  
a very helpful result for a  
reasonable interpretation of the  
query.

### 21.0 Product Queries: Importance of Browsing and Researching

Some product queries, such as \[ipad reviews\], have a clear information-seeking ( **Know** ) intent. Other product queries,  
such as \[buy ipad\], have a clear purchase ( **Do** ) intent. And some product queries, such as \[ipad store.apple.com\], have a  
clear navigation ( **Website** ) intent. However, most product queries don’t obviously specify one type of intent.  
Keep in mind that many users enjoy browsing and visually exploring products online, similar to window shopping in real  
life. Give high Needs Met ratings to results that allow users to research, browse, and decide what to purchase.  
Users may not always plan to buy products online that they are browsing and researching, for example, cars or major  
appliances. Even though the ultimate goal may be to purchase a product, many other activities may take place first:  
researching the product (reviews, technical specifications), understanding the options that are available (brands, models,  
pricing), viewing and considering various options (browsing), etc.  
**Important** : Page Quality ratings for product results need extra care and attention.  
**Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating Explanation**  
**Query:** \[high definition  
tv\]  
**User Intent:** This query  
doesn’t specify a size or  
brand of TV. Users are  
probably doing research  
before making a  
purchase.  
This LP has comprehensive  
information about different types  
of high definition TVs (plasma,  
LCD, LED), as well as reviews  
about many specific models. The  
website is known for having  
helpful reviews and information  
about electronics.  
**Query:** \[girl toddler jeans  
size 3T\]  
**User Intent:** The query  
is very specific. The  
user wants to browse  
and find an item to buy.  
This is a helpful page for  
browsing and shopping for toddler  
girls jeans. There are many  
options for jeans in size 3T. This  
is a high quality store known for  
selling jeans.  
**Query:** \[cufflinks\]  
**User Intent:** Most users  
probably want to find  
different cufflink styles  
and options to browse or  
purchase.  
This LP has a large collection of  
cufflinks from a very reputable  
retailer. There are many options  
and styles. This is a good page  
for browsing. There are helpful  
features at the top to choose  
styles, price ranges, etc.

Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation  
Query: \[twist of fate ring pandora\]  
User Intent: The user is looking  
for a specific ring sold by the  
Pandora brand and likely wants to  
research the ring, see what it  
looks like, find options to browse  
or purchase, etc.  
This result has a variety of  
images of the ring, showing  
different angles and materials.  
Knowing what the ring looks like  
is very helpful to users who are  
researching the product and  
browsing options that are  
available.

### 22.0 Rating Visit-in-Person Intent Queries

When there is a user location for a visit-in-person intent query and a location has not been specified in the query itself,  
such as \[chinese restaurants\] with a user location of **Boston, MA** , results in or near the user location are the most helpful.  
How close is “near”? The type of business and/or entity should be taken into consideration when deciding if the distance  
of the visit-in-person result is too far. For example, most people are not willing to travel very far for a gas station, coffee  
shop, supermarket, etc. Those are types of businesses that most users expect to find nearby.  
However, users might be willing to travel a little farther for certain kinds of visit-in-person results: doctors’ offices, libraries,  
specific types of restaurants, public facilities like swimming pools, hiking trails in open spaces, etc. Sometimes users  
may accept results that are even farther away, such as a very specialized medical clinic.  
In other words, when we say users are looking for results “nearby,” the word “nearby” can mean different distances for  
different queries. As always, please use your judgment.

#### 22.1 Examples Where User Location Does (and Does Not) Matter

As previously mentioned, the user location may not always change our understanding of the query and user intent. Below  
is one example where user location plays an important role, and two examples where user location does not matter.  
**Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation**  
**Query:** \[minimum wage  
rate\]  
**User Location:** Wichita,  
Kansas  
**User Intent:** Find out  
what the current  
minimum wage is.  
Different states in the  
U.S. have different  
minimum wage rates.  
Users might be  
interested in the  
minimum wage in their  
state and how it  
compares to other  
places.  
This result block displays the complete and  
correct answer prominently in the result  
block, in a way that is easy for users on  
mobile devices to read.  
**Note** : Assume that the result shows  
current information for users at the time  
this example was written. If you were  
rating this task, you would need to verify  
that the minimum wage rate in this result  
block is accurate for the state of Kansas.  
This is the official Kansas state website  
page on minimum wage for Kansas.  
This LP has the minimum wage rates for  
all states. It is on the official U.S.  
Department of Labor website. Though it  
takes some work to find the information  
specific to Kansas, this is a very helpful  
result for users seeking general  
information about the minimum wage rate.  
This is the official California state website  
page on minimum wage for California.  
Given the user location, this is an unhelpful  
result.

**Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation**  
**Query:** \[amazon jobs\]  
**User Location:** Miami,  
Florida  
**User Intent:** Users are  
looking for job  
opportunities at Amazon.  
The user is looking for a job at Amazon  
and there is no information in this result  
block that will help the user explore job  
opportunities—it **Fails to Meet** the user  
need.  
This is Amazon’s official page on careers  
and jobs at Amazon, where users can  
search for currently open opportunities.  
This page is exactly what the user is  
looking for—it **Fully Meets** the user need.

### 23.0 Rating English Language Results in Non-English Locales

**The following rating guidance is for raters in non-English locales. You may stop reading this section if your task**  
**language is English, such as English (US), English (IN), English (NG), etc.**  
Your Needs Met ratings should reflect how helpful the result is for users in your locale. When the query is in the language  
of your locale, assume that users want results in that language. We know that **you** can read English (you are reading this  
document\!), but you should only give high Needs Met ratings to English results if users in your locale would expect or  
want them for a particular query. Unless requested by the query, English results should be considered useless if most  
users in the locale can't read them.  
However, rating can be more difficult when the query includes English names, words, etc., or when it's unclear whether  
English results would be satisfying for a particular query. Please use your judgment and knowledge of your locale to  
determine the appropriate rating.  
**Important:** Please keep in mind that every locale will have unique considerations regarding the number and variety of  
languages (such as official languages, regional languages, local dialects, etc.), writing systems, and keyboard input  
languages commonly in use. While these guidelines may not include examples for your locale, it is important that you  
represent users in your task location and culture in order to interpret the query and rate results. When in doubt, please  
assume that users would prefer results in the task language unless the query clearly indicates otherwise.

#### 23.1 Examples of English (and Non-English) Results in Non-English Locales

The section includes some examples using Hindi (IN) and Korean (KR) as the locales. In both cases, we cannot assume  
that users in these locales—i.e., Hindi-speaking users in India, or Korean-speaking users in Korea—are able to read  
English. Unless most users in the locale would be satisfied by English results for the query, we will consider them  
unhelpful or even useless ( **FailsM** ).  
**Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation**  
**Query:** \[ राजा रव वमा \]  
**Locale:** Hindi (IN)  
**User Intent:** The user wants to  
find information  
about राजा रव वमा, an Indian artist.  
This Hindi language Wikipedia  
page on राजा रव वमा is very  
helpful for Hindi (IN) users.  
This English Wikipedia page  
about राजा रव वमा has similar  
content to the Hindi Wikipedia  
page. Although there are some  
helpful images on the page, few  
Hindi users would be able to read  
this page.  
**Query:** \[ 버락 오바마 \]  
**Locale:** Korean (KR)  
**User Intent:** 버락 오바마 is Barack  
Obama in Korean, so the user  
wants to find information about  
Barack Obama.  
This Korean language Wikipedia  
page on Barack Obama is very  
helpful for Korean (KR) users.  
This English Wikipedia page  
about Barack Obama has similar  
content to the Korean Wikipedia  
page. Although there are some  
helpful images on the page, very  
few Korean users would be able  
to read this page.

Here are two examples where the query includes proper nouns typed in Latin script, such as famous people, places, titles  
of books or films, etc. For these queries, users would prefer to see results in the language of their locale.  
**Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation**  
**Query:** \[ ronaldo \]  
**Locale:** Hindi (IN)  
**User Intent:** The user wants to  
find information about Cristiano  
Ronaldo, a famous footballer.  
Although the query was typed in  
Latin script, most Hindi users  
would want to see information  
about this person in Hindi. This  
Hindi language Wikipedia page  
on Cristiano Ronaldo is very  
helpful for Hindi (IN) users.  
This English Wikipedia page  
about Cristiano Ronaldo has  
similar content to the Hindi  
Wikipedia page. Although there  
are some helpful images on the  
page, few Hindi users would be  
able to read this page.  
**Query:** \[titanic 1997\]  
**Locale:** Korean (KR)  
**User Intent:** T he user wants to  
purchase a DVD or find  
information about the movie  
“Titanic,” released in 1997\.  
Although the query was typed in  
Latin script, most Korean users  
would expect to see Korean  
language reviews or Korean  
stores for purchasing the movie.  
This Korean result on a Korean  
website is very helpful.  
This English language landing  
page has helpful content for users  
who can read English. Although  
there are some helpful images on  
the page, very few Korean users  
would be able to read this page.

Here are two additional examples where the query was typed in Latin script (including some English words), yet users  
would still prefer to see results in the language of their locale.  
**Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation**  
**Query:** \[ mahila cricket sri lanka  
ka match\]  
**Locale:** Hindi (IN)  
**User Intent:** The user wants to  
find information about a women’s  
cricket match against Sri Lanka  
on February 17, 2016\.  
Although the query includes some  
English words, it is a Hindi query  
typed in Latin script. Most Hindi  
users would expect to see Hindi  
results, like this helpful article.  
This English language landing  
page has helpful content for users  
who can read English, but few  
Hindi (IN) users would be able to  
read this page.  
**Query:** \[samsung tablet\]  
**Locale:** Korean (KR)  
**User Intent:** The user wants to  
purchase, find information, or go  
to the Galaxy tablet page on the  
Samsung website.  
Although the query was typed in  
Latin script and includes some  
English words, most Korean  
users would expect to see the  
Korean page on the Samsung  
website. This Korean result is  
very helpful.  
This English language page on  
the website of Samsung, the  
company that makes this tablet,  
has helpful content. Although  
there are some helpful images on  
the page, very few Korean users  
would be able to read this page.

On the other hand, there may be queries where the needs of most users would actually be satisfied by English language  
results, even if the query itself is typed in the task language.  
For example, for queries about global businesses and organizations, users may expect or want to visit the English  
language version of the business/organization's official website in some locales. Similarly, for queries seeking technical  
information such as manufacturer part numbers, product specs, scientific or chemical formulas, etc., the answer to the  
query may be typically expressed in the English language in some locales.  
For these queries, users may expect or want to see English results in order to satisfy their need. Please use your  
judgment and knowledge of your locale to determine the appropriate rating.  
**Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation**  
**Query:** \[ हावड वेबसाइट\]  
**Locale:** Hindi (IN)  
**User Intent:** हावड वेबसाइट is  
"Harvard website" in Hindi. Users  
want to go to the official website  
of Harvard University, which is a  
well-known research university in  
Cambridge, Massachusetts.  
This is the official website of  
Harvard University. Even though  
the query was typed in Hindi, this  
English website is clearly what  
users are looking for. Users  
would be fully satisfied by this  
result.  
**Query:** \[시스코 카탈리스트 스위치  
IOS 복원하기\]  
**Locale:** Korean (KR)  
**User Intent:** This Korean query  
can be translated as "recovering  
IOS on Cisco Catalyst switches".  
The user wants to find out how to  
restore the IOS operating system  
on a Cisco Catalyst switch, which  
is a specific brand/model of  
computer networking device.  
This article comes from a blog  
that contains lots of technical  
information and troubleshooting  
tips about IT operations and  
programming. The landing page  
provides step-by-step instructions  
in Korean, along with the exact  
commands in English that users  
would need to type into a console  
in order to recover the operating  
system for the queried device.  
This tutorial would be very helpful  
and easy to follow for Korean  
users who are familiar with this  
type of networking device.

Finally, in some locales, English is one of the official languages or a commonly spoken language. In these locales,  
English websites are easy to use and could be helpful, depending on the query.  
For example, the Singapore government recognizes four official languages: English, Malay, Chinese, and Tamil, but  
English is the first and most dominant language in Singapore.  
**Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation**  
**Query:** \[barack obama\]  
**Locale:** English (SG)  
**User Intent:** Find information  
about Barack Obama.  
This Wikipedia page in English  
about Obama would be very  
helpful to users in Singapore.

### 24.0 Rating Dictionary and Encyclopedia Results for Different Queries

When assigning Needs Met ratings for dictionary and encyclopedia results, careful attention must be paid to the user  
intent. Like all results, the helpfulness of dictionary and encyclopedia results depend on the query and user intent.  
Dictionary and encyclopedia results may be topically relevant for many searches, but often these results are not helpful for  
common words that most people in your rating locale already understand. Reserve high Needs Met ratings for dictionary  
and encyclopedia results when the user intent for the query is likely "what is it" or "what does it mean" and the result is  
helpful for users seeking that type of information.  
**Important** : Think about how helpful it is to get dictionary or encyclopedia results for very common words. Often there  
may be much more likely and reasonable intents. If you think most people know the meaning of the word and it is unlikely  
that people would be looking for the definition, a **Slightly Meets** rating may be appropriate.  
**Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation**  
**Query:** \[ obsequious \]  
**User Intent:** Users are probably  
looking for the definition of this  
vocabulary word.  
This is a vocabulary word often  
studied in secondary school and  
found on college entrance exams.  
Many users may be looking for a  
definition and would find this  
dictionary result helpful.

**Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation**  
**Query:** \[ rainbow \]  
**User Intent:** This is a broad  
query. Users could be looking for  
many things, including images of  
rainbows, brands or local  
stores/organizations with  
"rainbow" in their name, etc.  
Most users probably already  
know what a rainbow is and  
would not be looking for a  
definition. Even if the user needs  
help understanding the word,  
images or a simple description  
would be more helpful than this  
dictionary result.  
**Query:** \[ cafeteria \]  
**User Location:** Eugene, Oregon  
**User Intent:** Most  
English-speaking users in the US  
are familiar with cafeterias. Users  
are most likely looking for a place  
to eat.  
Most users are looking for a place  
to eat rather than general  
information about cafeterias.  
Even though this is an in-depth  
encyclopedia article that matches  
the topic of the query, this is not a  
very helpful result.  
**Query:** \[ history of ATM machines \]  
**User Intent:** Find information  
about the history of ATM  
machines (e.g., the inventor,  
when it was invented, its  
evolution, etc.).  
The user wants to learn more  
information about the history of  
ATM machines. This  
encyclopedia article includes an  
extensive section on ATM  
machine history. This is a very  
helpful result.

**Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation**  
**Query:** \[ atm near me \]  
**User Location:** Livingston,  
Wyoming  
**User Intent:** Find ATMs near the  
user location.  
The user intent is to find a nearby  
ATM machine. This encyclopedia  
article fails to meet the need of  
the user because it has no  
information about nearby ATM  
locations.

## Appendix 1: Using the Evaluation Platform

### 25.0 Overview

The Evaluation Platform is the system you will use to acquire and rate tasks. You can access the Evaluation Platform by  
going to this link: [http://www.raterhub.com/evaluation/rater](http://www.raterhub.com/evaluation/rater)  
As a Search Quality Rater, you will work on many different types of rating tasks. This section provides guidance on how  
to use certain features of the Evaluation Platform that you will encounter frequently in Page Quality (PQ) and Needs Met  
(NM) rating tasks. Some of these concepts may apply to other types of rating tasks as well.  
**Important:** Many tasks that you receive will display project \-specific instructions on the task page. You should always  
follow these project-specific instructions when they are provided.

### 26.0 Acquiring Tasks

Here is a simplified screenshot of the task acquisition page on the Evaluation Platform. Please note that changes are  
sometimes made to the appearance of this page, so it may not look exactly as it appears below.  
A few notes about how to acquire tasks from this page:  
**● rater@gmail.com:** Make sure you are logged in to the account you used to sign up for the rating program.  
**● Acquire if available:** Click this button to acquire a new task.  
● **Headphones or speakers required:** This label indicates that the task requires headphones or speakers (for  
example, to listen to an audio file).  
Please note you may see other types of labels next to the button on the task acquisition page. Sometimes there  
will be only one button, while other times you may see more than one button displayed to distinguish tasks with  
different requirements. When there is more than one displayed, you may choose the one you want to acquire.

### 27.0 Rating Tasks Using the Rating Interface

Here is a general outline of the steps you should follow upon acquiring a task:

1. **Read the instructions:** Pay close attention to any project-specific instructions and examples if provided.  
2. **Fill out the task:** Assign ratings to result blocks, provide comments, answer questions, etc. (as applicable).  
3. **Check your work:** Verify that you entered your ratings as intended. Additionally, make sure that you provided a  
   response to all required questions.  
4. **Submit the task:** Click the "Submit" button at the end of the page to submit the task and continue rating.  
   Alternatively, click "Submit and Stop Rating" to submit the task and return to the Evaluation Platform homepage.

Additionally, here are a few general things to keep in mind when rating tasks:  
● **Result blocks are sometimes slow to load:** Before assigning any ratings, please scan the task page to make  
sure that all result blocks have loaded. Please note that result blocks may be slow to load and/or that the task  
page may need reloading if there are empty result blocks. If the result blocks fail to load after refreshing a few  
times, please release the task by following the instructions in Section 28.0 below.  
● **Sometimes a side will not have any result blocks:** If one side displays the message “This side did not generate  
any results,” please do not release the task.  
● **Do not refresh the task page after assigning ratings:** If you refresh the page after assigning ratings, you will  
lose them and they will have to be entered again.

### 28.0 Releasing Tasks

Most raters have difficulty rating some tasks now and then. Some queries are about highly technical topics (e.g.,  
computer science or physics) or involve very specialized areas of interest (e.g., gaming or torrents).  
You will report problems and release tasks using the “Report a Problem / Release this Task” button in the rating interface.  
Here is what the “Report a Problem / Release this Task” button looks like:  
Clicking the red button displays a menu with several reporting and release options:  
Please note that changes are sometimes made to this menu, so it may not look exactly as it appears above.

In general, you should choose whichever option best describes your reason for releasing the task. If you are unsure,  
please select the closest option, or contact your employer/company for further guidance.  
Please leave a comment explaining the release when it makes sense to provide additional information, for example, when  
you are releasing for a “technical problem.”  
Here are some examples for the "lack expertise” and “technical problem” release options.  
**Lack expertise:** These queries require specialized knowledge and may be difficult for some raters.  
**Query General Query Topic**  
\[cortisol secretion shows a blank pattern of secretion\] Scientific query  
\[minecraft gun and vehicles 1.1 mod installer\] Gaming query  
\[python pandas index like matrix\] Technical query  
**Technical problem:** These result blocks have question marks and other characters where text should be.  
Note: Based on the number and/or type of tasks that you release, you may be asked to provide additional details about  
the reason for some of the releases.

### 29.0 Understanding the User Location on the Task Page

The location of the user should be inferred from the map provided. The map can help clarify where the user was  
physically located when the query was issued.  
On the map, the user location can be precise (blue dot), approximate (blue rectangle or circle), or missing altogether if the  
user location is unknown. Here are some examples of what you might see at the top of the task:  
A precise user location  
is represented by a blue  
dot ( ).  
Sometimes you will see  
a shaded blue circle  
around the blue dot. The  
blue dot is the user’s  
most likely location, but  
it is possible they are  
located anywhere within  
the larger shaded blue  
region.  
The user can be located  
anywhere within the  
blue rectangle on the  
map.  
The map includes a  
response pin, which is a  
marker for a  
visit-in-person result  
block in the task. If  
there are three  
visit-in-person result  
blocks in the task, there  
should be three  
response pins on the  
map.

### 30.0 Reporting Duplicate Results in Tasks

In some rating tasks, you may be asked to determine whether any results are Duplicates (dupes). This section provides  
guidance and examples of how to report duplicate results In Needs Met (NM) rating tasks.

#### 30.1 Pre-Identified Duplicates

Some duplicate results are automatically detected and will be pre-identified for you. They will be annotated by the text  
“ **Same as** ...” right below the slider and above the result block.  
This is what these pre-identified dupes look like:  
**Left Side Right Side**  
**Please note** : You cannot unselect dupes that have been automatically detected and pre-identified.

#### 30.2 Rater-Identified Duplicates

You are also asked to help identify duplicate results that have not been automatically detected. Please mark two results  
as dupes if they have essentially the same content on the main landing page AND you would not want a search engine to  
return both results for the query.  
Please note that in Needs Met rating and other query-based tasks, dupe identification is **query-dependent**.  
● **Specific queries** : For queries where the user is looking for a specific piece of content (such as queries looking for  
song lyrics, queries looking for a specific article, etc.), obtaining that piece of content from **different sites** could  
be helpful for users to verify the information, so they should **not** be rated as dupes.  
● **Broad queries** : If the query is broad, results may be considered dupes even if they have minor content  
differences on the page (such as different ads, images, or related links).  
Please identify dupes both within the same side and across sides. Even for cross-side results, you should still ask  
yourself the question, “Would users want to see both results if they were returned by the same search engine?”  
**Note** : If two result blocks have very different types of content or very different appearances, do not mark them as  
duplicates even if they have the same landing page URL. For example, these two blocks should not be marked as  
duplicates of each other.

#### 30.3 Reporting Duplicate Results

When you notice that the results in two or more result blocks are duplicates, please click on the **Select Dupe** link at the  
top of one of the results. The current result (the result you clicked on) will be highlighted in red at the top of the block.  
You can then check results that are duplicates of the current result, and the checked results will be highlighted in yellow.  
You must select the “ **Dupe of** ...” button.  
The duplicate results that you checked will be annotated by " **Dupe of** ..." text at the top of the block. After selecting all  
dupes, click on the **finish selecting dupes** link to return to the normal rating mode. The link’s name will change back to  
**Select Dupes** , and you will be able to report other sets of dupes, if there are any. If you change your mind, you can  
always uncheck a result.  
**Dupes**  
QUERY: \[choosing and installing a motorcycle battery\]  
URL 1: [http://www.caimag.com/wordpress/2010/03/06/motorcycle-battery-how-to-choose-install](http://www.caimag.com/wordpress/2010/03/06/motorcycle-battery-how-to-choose-install)  
URL 2: [http://www.articlesbase.com/motorcycles-articles/choosing-and-installing-a-motorcycle-battery-47798.html](http://www.articlesbase.com/motorcycles-articles/choosing-and-installing-a-motorcycle-battery-47798.html)  
**Reason** : Both of these results display the same article (which also appears on many other pages on the web). The only  
real difference between the landing pages are the Ads displayed around the article. The query is broad enough that users  
would **not** benefit by search engines returning more than one of these results.  
**Dupes**  
QUERY: \[jason castro\]  
URL 1: [http://www.myspace.com/jasoncastromusic](http://www.myspace.com/jasoncastromusic)  
URL 2: [http://www.myspace.com/jasoncastromusic?MyToken=503599bf-01cf-4427-bdf4-d63920c107f9](http://www.myspace.com/jasoncastromusic?MyToken=503599bf-01cf-4427-bdf4-d63920c107f9)  
**Reason** : These two results have the same landing page, even though the URLs are different. Users would **not** benefit by  
search engines returning both results.  
**Not Dupes**  
QUERY: \[material girl lyrics\]  
URL 1: [http://www.lyricsfreak.com/m/madonna/material+girl\_20086925.html](http://www.lyricsfreak.com/m/madonna/material+girl_20086925.html)  
URL 2: [http://www.lyrics007.com/Madonna%20Lyrics/Material%20Girl%20Lyrics.html](http://www.lyrics007.com/Madonna%20Lyrics/Material%20Girl%20Lyrics.html)  
**Reason** : Even though both pages display the lyrics to the song “Material Girl,” users would probably want to have the  
option to visit both pages so that they could verify the accuracy of the lyrics. Users could benefit by search engines  
returning more than one page with the lyrics to the song.

### 31.0 Simplified Needs Met Tasks

Some Needs Met rating tasks may not require ratings for all blocks. In these blocks, the Needs Met and Page Quality  
rating scales will be greyed out and annotated with the text "No Rating Required".  
The greyed-out results (sometimes referred to as "contextual results") are shown to help you understand the query and  
inform your ratings. You can click on them when you feel like they will be helpful in determining your ratings.  
Here is an example:
